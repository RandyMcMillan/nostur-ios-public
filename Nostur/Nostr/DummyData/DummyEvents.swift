    events.append(###"["EVENT","3bca337a-8db2-45ca-af4b-c7ba34d04acc",{"content":"All Your (Advertising) Models are Broken\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe modern advertising model on centralized social media platforms is, to put it mildly, a shitshow. It’s annoying for users, gives barely any monetary value to creators, and is questionably effective for advertisers.\n\n_**What’s the Problem?**_\n\nSocial media platforms collect vast amounts of user data and use that data to offer companies “targeted” advertising, allowing them to spend their marketing dollars to deliver ads to specific audiences based on their demographics, interests, and behaviors.\n\nWhile this model might be beneficial for some companies (and certainly for the platforms who are selling the ad space, like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.), it is a disaster for social media _users_. The entire model relies on extracting as much information as possible about users, and bombarding them with algorithmically chosen ads. It’s a nightmare for data privacy and ruins the user experience.\n\n**Additionally, value creators on centralized social media platforms rarely receive any compensation for their content being used as the vehicle for targeted advertising.** If they do, it’s a tiny fraction of the amount being spent by the advertiser, with the majority of marketing dollars going to the social media platform.\n\n**_Imagine a new advertising model where advertisers could pay content creators directly to get their ads featured on the creator’s post._** \n\nThe more they pay, the more visibility their ad will receive; a truly free market. No middlemen to take a cut, just an advertiser giving value directly to a creator so that their ad will be seen alongside top-tier content produced by the creator. This would reduce costs for advertisers and increase value given to creators simultaneously.\n\n**_Sounds great, right?_**\n\nNow imagine this all happens on an open, decentralized protocol and the value given to the creator is an internet-native money, sent and received at the speed of light.\n\nWell, you don’t have to imagine it. This is possible _right now_ on [Nostr](https://www.btctimes.com/news/what-is-nostr-how-does-it-work-why-does-it-matter) using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nI’m calling this new model “**_zapvertising_**.” \n\n**_How Does Zapvertising Work?_**\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, a “_zap_” on Nostr is Bitcoin payment made directly to the creator of a note, sent via the Lightning Network. It’s a way of giving value for value, and many Nostr users on [Damus](https://damus.io/) (an iOS Nostr client built by [Will AKA jb55](https://snort.social/p/npub1xtscya34g58tk0z605fvr788k263gsu6cy9x0mhnm87echrgufzsevkk5s)) are already using zaps exclusively instead of “likes.”\n\nYou can watch zaps in real time on [https://zaplife.lol](https://zaplife.lol/) \n\nWhen you zap someone, you can opt to _“send a reply with your zap.”_ This could be a simple message, an image, a video, a link to your website, etc. Zaps on a note are ranked with the highest zapped amount at the top, so the more you zap, the higher up in the zap list your comment will be.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve tried the zapvertising model out myself with my website [Footstr](https://footstr.com/). Whenever I send a zap, I include the link as a comment ([https://footstr.com/](https://footstr.com/)). Without posting the website link anywhere but on Nostr, it’s already received _thousands_ of unique visits.   \nFor those of you who are not familiar with footstr, it’s a viral Nostr trend I started where people post pictures of their feet with the hashtag #footstr.\n\n**_Yes, it is absurd_**, but its purpose was to showcase the potential for trend virality on Nostr, and test out the effectiveness of zapvertising.\n\n_**Let’s Go Deeper**_\n\nNaturally, there are some potential drawbacks to this. For example, given Nostr is an open protocol, _anyone_ could advertise _anything_ on a creator’s post by sending them a zap, including a product or service that the creator personally finds abhorrent. \n\nHowever, this is also a problem with the legacy advertising model; creators on Twitter have zero control over what ads are shown to followers on their posts or on their profile. **_At least with the Nostr model, the creator actually gets paid._**\n\nThe Nostr _zapvertising_ model creates a truly free market for advertisers, while allowing creators to simply keep doing what they’re doing. Creators don’t need to be blatant shills for brands, they just have to create high quality content people find valuable, and companies will naturally want to _zapvertise_ on their posts.\n\nIn contrast to “influencer marketing,” Nostr marketing doesn’t require creators to sell their souls and shill products they don’t believe in just to make a quick buck. However, if a creator sees that your company is zapping a lot of people, they may decide to create content that promotes your brand, in the hopes that you will in turn zap them for the value they’ve created.\n\nCompanies can also use zaps as a way to directly target a specific person who they want to see their product. These types of zaps would be higher in volume and have a lower value attached, given your goal is simply to be seen by the receiver, not to get your message to the top of the zap list.\n\nAdditionally, companies that zap Nostr **_developers_** will receive dual benefits:\n\n1.  You will be viewed positively by the Nostr community for supporting open source developers building solutions used by a worldwide community.\n2.  You can embed any brand message you want in your zap to increase visibility.\n\n**Zapvertising will allow companies to support people building open source freedom technology and gain greater brand recognition in one fell swoop.**\n\n**_Zapvertising is Bigger Than Just Ads_**\n\nSo far I’ve focused on companies promoting themselves and their offerings via zapvertising, but the potential is so much greater than that…\n\nAre you a content **creator** who wants a prominent figure to see your latest video? Zap it to them.\n\nAre you a **non-profit** who wants to get visibility on your latest campaign? Zap the link.\n\nAre you hosting an **event** and want people to sign up? Zap the form.\n\nAre you a **developer** who wants people to beta test your app? Zap the invite.\n\nAre you **crowdfunding** an idea on [Geyser](https://geyser.fund/project/stopthepresses) and want to drive traffic to your donation page? Zap it around.\n\nAre you a **startup founder** who wants Jack Dorsey to take a look at your project? Zap it to him.\n\n**_Zap Replies vs Regular Replies_**\n\nWhy is zapvertising superior to ordinary replies in terms of gaining visibility? There are currently no algorithms to boost your reach on Nostr; notes are all chronological. So, when you comment a link, image, etc. on a high-traffic note, chances are that comment will be lost immediately in the deluge of other comments.\n\n**With zapped comments, you can guarantee that your link will stay at the top of the list, because zaps are ordered by amount, with the highest value zap at the top.** Zapping is also a great way for people to discover your profile on Nostr; people pay more attention when there is value received.\n\nAdditionally, simply commenting your link repeatedly on different posts is no different than spam, and will not be well-received. But when you attach value to your message by zapping it, you are directly paying the note creator to see your message, with the added benefit that others will see it, too.\n\n**Thanks to sites like [zaplife.lol](https://zaplife.lol/) and [primal.net](https://primal.net/), zaps are the closest thing we have on Nostr to trending discovery.**\n\nIf you’re not yet on Nostr you may be thinking _“that’s nice and all, but isn’t Nostr pretty small? How much reach can I possibly get?”_\n\nThat’s a fair question. Nostr only popped onto most people’s radars in December 2022, but the network is growing _rapidly_. There are very few businesses using Nostr right now, so you have an opportunity to be an early adopter and set yourself apart from the competition. \n\nUsers are also highly engaged compared to centralized platforms, and a massive amount of monetary value is already moving across the network. \n\nAccording to [primal.net](https://primal.net/explore), there are almost 500,000 active users on Nostr, over 600,000 zaps sent, almost seven bitcoin zapped, and approaching 100 MILLION total events.\n\nAll of this growth and value transfer happened organically. No CEO calling the shots, no marketing team, no investors. Just ordinary people around the world opting in to an open network because they believed it might be better than their walled garden.\n\n**_Gradually Then Suddenly_**\n\nEvery new idea seems crazy until it isn’t. If I would have told you in November 2022 that in less than six months we’d have a viable value for value workflow for Bitcoin built on top of an open, permissionless social media network you’d probably have laughed and gone back to tweeting.\n\nBut that’s exactly what we have now with zaps on Nostr.\n\nThe rate of development on Nostr is truly something to behold, and it’s thanks to the open nature of the network. On Nostr, no one needs permission to build something that might change the world.\n\nWill zapvertisements change the world? Probably not, but they might make it just a little bit better.\n\nWhether you’re a company or just an individual promoting a project, **zapvertisements allow you to give value and get value in return.**\n\n**_A Note to Fellow Nostriches_**\n\nFor those of you who have been using Nostr for some time, you may be thinking _“why is Walker trying to encourage companies to advertise on Nostr? We don’t want any corporate crap on our immaculate protocol!”_\n\n**I’ll tell you why: it’s the best way to bring more attention and monetary value to the network, drive more zaps to developers, and incentivize creators to try Nostr.**\n\nAs the network grows in value, value accrues to each user on the network (especially to early adopters).\n\nIf you believe, as I do, that Nostr will be the dominant protocol for social media (and much more) in the years to come, then it logically follows that every company will need to have a Nostr strategy, as they have social media strategies across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok today.\n\nPersonally, I would like to see as much monetary value as possible flowing into Nostr to give developers a fighting chance at remaining independent; I think zapvertising is one way to achieve that.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to share a vision for how we can change the current advertising paradigm by using Nostr to make _zapvertising_ the norm.\n\nYou can find me on Nostr using any of the following:\n\nnpub1cj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsqwrz4u\n\n[https://primal.net/walker](https://primal.net/walker)\n\n[https://nostrplebs.com/s/walker](https://nostrplebs.com/s/walker)","created_at":1682707764,"id":"9321d998b633a92ff9029f5925373743121d6d64b0e354b65a372601b7095879","kind":9802,"pubkey":"c48e29f04b482cc01ca1f9ef8c86ef8318c059e0e9353235162f080f26e14c11","sig":"cdf8d84423d3a5f14546748f460845fd24ae0dc88e57669e141beff6ebf648a1bb2881f19d58b9873c5c822e0c108a01a837c8e709c15355b67f92f5f09db6fe","tags":[["title","HIGHLIGHTER.com"],["excerpt","The modern advertising model on centralized social media platforms is, to put it mildly, a shitshow.

The entire model relies on extracting as much information as possible about users, and bombarding them with algorithmically chosen ads. It’s a nightmare for data privacy and ruins the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, value creators on centralized social media platforms rarely receive any compensation for their content being used as the vehicle for targeted advertising. If they do, it’s a tiny fraction of the amount being spent by the advertiser, with the majority of marketing dollars going to the social media platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine a new advertising model where advertisers could pay content creators directly to get their ads featured on the creator’s post. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more they pay, the more visibility their ad will receive; a truly free market. No middlemen to take a cut, just an advertiser giving value directly to a creator so that their ad will be seen alongside top-tier content produced by the creator. This would reduce costs for advertisers and increase value given to creators simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds great, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow imagine this all happens on an open, decentralized protocol and the value given to the creator is an internet-native money, sent and received at the speed of light.\n\n\n\nWell, you don’t have to imagine it. This is possible right now on Nostr using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m calling this new model “zapvertising.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does Zapvertising Work?\n\n\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, a “zap” on Nostr is Bitcoin payment made directly to the creator of a note, sent via the Lightning Network. It’s a way of giving value for value, and many Nostr users on Damus (an iOS Nostr client built by Will AKA jb55) are already using zaps exclusively instead of “likes.”\n\n\n\nYou can watch zaps in real time on https://zaplife.lol \n\n\n\nWhen you zap someone, you can opt to “send a reply with your zap.” This could be a simple message, an image, a video, a link to your website, etc. Zaps on a note are ranked with the highest zapped amount at the top, so the more you zap, the higher up in the zap list your comment will be.\n\n\n\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve tried the zapvertising model out myself with my website Footstr. Whenever I send a zap, I include the link as a comment (https://footstr.com/). Without posting the website link anywhere but on Nostr, it’s already received thousands of unique visits. For those of you who are not familiar with footstr, it’s a viral Nostr trend I started where people post pictures of their feet with the hashtag #footstr. \n\n\n\nYes, it is absurd, but its purpose was to showcase the potential for trend virality on Nostr, and test out the effectiveness of zapvertising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s Go Deeper\n\n\n\nNaturally, there are some potential drawbacks to this. For example, given Nostr is an open protocol, anyone could advertise anything on a creator’s post by sending them a zap, including a product or service that the creator personally finds abhorrent. \n\n\n\nHowever, this is also a problem with the legacy advertising model; creators on Twitter have zero control over what ads are shown to followers on their posts or on their profile. At least with the Nostr model, the creator actually gets paid.\n\n\n\nThe Nostr zapvertising model creates a truly free market for advertisers, while allowing creators to simply keep doing what they’re doing. Creators don’t need to be blatant shills for brands, they just have to create high quality content people find valuable, and companies will naturally want to zapvertise on their posts.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to “influencer marketing,” Nostr marketing doesn’t require creators to sell their souls and shill products they don’t believe in just to make a quick buck. However, if a creator sees that your company is zapping a lot of people, they may decide to create content that promotes your brand, in the hopes that you will in turn zap them for the value they’ve created.\n\n\n\nCompanies can also use zaps as a way to directly target a specific person who they want to see their product. These types of zaps would be higher in volume and have a lower value attached, given your goal is simply to be seen by the receiver, not to get your message to the top of the zap list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, companies that zap Nostr developers will receive dual benefits:\n\n\n\n\nYou will be viewed positively by the Nostr community for supporting open source developers building solutions used by a worldwide community.\n\n\n\nYou can embed any brand message you want in your zap to increase visibility.\n\n\n\n\nZapvertising will allow companies to support people building open source freedom technology and gain greater brand recognition in one fell swoop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZapvertising is Bigger Than Just Ads\n\n\n\nSo far I’ve focused on companies promoting themselves and their offerings via zapvertising, but the potential is so much greater than that…\n\n\n\nAre you a content creator who wants a prominent figure to see your latest video? Zap it to them.\n\n\n\nAre you a non-profit who wants to get visibility on your latest campaign? Zap the link.\n\n\n\nAre you hosting an event and want people to sign up? Zap the form.\n\n\n\nAre you a developer who wants people to beta test your app? Zap the invite.\n\n\n\nAre you crowdfunding an idea on Geyser and want to drive traffic to your donation page? Zap it around.\n\n\n\nAre you a startup founder who wants Jack Dorsey to take a look at your project? Zap it to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZap Replies vs Regular Replies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is zapvertising superior to ordinary replies in terms of gaining visibility? There are currently no algorithms to boost your reach on Nostr; notes are all chronological. So, when you comment a link, image, etc. on a high-traffic note, chances are that comment will be lost immediately in the deluge of other comments.\n\n\n\nWith zapped comments, you can guarantee that your link will stay at the top of the list, because zaps are ordered by amount, with the highest value zap at the top. Zapping is also a great way for people to discover your profile on Nostr; people pay more attention when there is value received.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, simply commenting your link repeatedly on different posts is no different than spam, and will not be well-received. But when you attach value to your message by zapping it, you are directly paying the note creator to see your message, with the added benefit that others will see it, too.\n\n\n\nThanks to sites like zaplife.lol and primal.net, zaps are the closest thing we have on Nostr to trending discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re not yet on Nostr you may be thinking “that’s nice and all, but isn’t Nostr pretty small? How much reach can I possibly get?”\n\n\n\nThat’s a fair question. Nostr only popped onto most people’s radars in December 2022, but the network is growing rapidly. There are very few businesses using Nostr right now, so you have an opportunity to be an early adopter and set yourself apart from the competition. \n\n\n\nUsers are also highly engaged compared to centralized platforms, and a massive amount of monetary value is already moving across the network. \n\n\n\nAccording to primal.net, there are almost 500,000 active users on Nostr, over 600,000 zaps sent, almost seven bitcoin zapped, and approaching 100 MILLION total events.\n\n\n\nAll of this growth and value transfer happened organically. No CEO calling the shots, no marketing team, no investors. Just ordinary people around the world opting in to an open network because they believed it might be better than their walled garden.\n\n\n\nGradually Then Suddenly\n\n\n\nEvery new idea seems crazy until it isn’t. If I would have told you in November 2022 that in less than six months we’d have a viable value for value workflow for Bitcoin built on top of an open, permissionless social media network you’d probably have laughed and gone back to tweeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s exactly what we have now with zaps on Nostr. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of development on Nostr is truly something to behold, and it’s thanks to the open nature of the network. On Nostr, no one needs permission to build something that might change the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill zapvertisements change the world? Probably not, but they might make it just a little bit better.\n\n\n\nWhether you’re a company or just an individual promoting a project, zapvertisements allow you to give value and get value in return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note to Fellow Nostriches\n\n\n\nFor those of you who have been using Nostr for some time, you may be thinking “why is Walker trying to encourage companies to advertise on Nostr? We don’t want any corporate crap on our immaculate protocol!”\n\n\n\nI’ll tell you why: it’s the best way to bring more attention and monetary value to the network, drive more zaps to developers, and incentivize creators to try Nostr.\n\n\n\nAs the network grows in value, value accrues to each user on the network (especially to early adopters).\n\n\n\nIf you believe, as I do, that Nostr will be the dominant protocol for social media (and much more) in the years to come, then it logically follows that every company will need to have a Nostr strategy, as they have social media strategies across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok today.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I would like to see as much monetary value as possible flowing into Nostr to give developers a fighting chance at remaining independent; I think zapvertising is one way to achieve that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this article is to share a vision for how we can change the current advertising paradigm by using Nostr to make zapvertising the norm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find me on Nostr using any of the following:\n\n\n\nnpub1cj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsqwrz4u\n\n\n\nhttps://primal.net/walker\n\n\n\nhttps://nostrplebs.com/s/walker\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n"],["length","10429"],["r","https://highlighter.com/load?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffootstr.com%2Fzapvertise%2F&author=npub1cj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsqwrz4u"],["published_at","1682707764"]]}]"###)

As interest in the concept of \"states' rights\" reaches an all-time high, states are exploring bills to limit the use of the federal government's proposed central bank digital currency, or CBDC.\n\n![](https://www.bitcoinbrief.io/content/images/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-25-194546.png)\n\nGoogle Trends: Interest in \"States Rights\"\n\nCBDCs are fully digital currencies issued directly by central banks to citizens. Like paper dollars, CBDCs are [central bank liabilities](https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm). But unlike paper dollars, which provide high levels of financial privacy, CBDCs [undermine the individual right to privacy](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2022-11/working-paper-70.pdf?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) by giving \"the federal government complete visibility into every financial transaction by establishing a direct link between the government and each citizens’ financial activity.\"\n\nCBDCs combine this mass surveillance capability with programmability, creating the frightening potential to restrict purchases of certain goods and services to achieve policy goals (for example, preventing SNAP recipients from buying alcohol; rationing gasoline, propane, or even meat to fight climate change; imposing spending limits on ammunition or prohibiting the purchase of certain types of firearms; preventing spending on reproductive health or medical marijuana/psychedelics). CBDCs will also give the central bank levers of fine-tuned economic control, by, for example, incentivizing spending or saving at the individual level through dollars with expiration dates.\n\nIn other words, CBDCs are a central planner's dream come true. Indeed, the CCP in China is [pioneering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2021/04/07/chinas-digital-currency-is-about-to-disrupt-money/?sh=72dadbff1665&ref=bitcoinbrief.io) them.\n\nBoth Florida and North Dakota have asserted their sovereign powers over trade and commerce within their borders to resist this application of federal power over money. Specifically, both states have opposed amending their respective commercial codes to include new definitions of \"money\" proposed in the Uniform Commercial Code (drafted by a private body of attorneys and lawmakers that crafts model codes to promote uniformity across states). The governors of these two states believe the proposed amendments will pave the way for CBDCs by including government-issued digital currencies in the definition of \"money\", while at the same time excluding non-governmental digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe governor of Florida, Ron Desantis, has advocated for a [law](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7049/BillText/Filed/PDF?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) that would preclude recognizing CBDCs as \"money\" in Florida's commercial code. As [his office explained it](https://www.flgov.com/2023/03/20/governor-ron-desantis-announces-legislation-to-protect-floridians-from-a-federally-controlled-central-bank-digital-currency-and-surveillance-state/?ref=bitcoinbrief.io):\n\n> The legislative proposal protects consumers and businesses from a federally controlled CBDC by:\n> \n> Expressly prohibiting the use of a federally adopted Central Bank Digital Currency as money within Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).\n> \n> Instituting protections against a central global currency by prohibiting any CBDC issued by a foreign reserve or foreign sanctioned central bank.\n> \n> Calling on likeminded states to join Florida in adopting similar prohibitions within their respective Commercial Codes to fight back against this concept nationwide.\n\nAnd Governor Kristi Noem of North Dakota vetoed the UCC amendments passed by the state's legislature, stating her belief that the amendments \"open\\[\\] the door to the risk that the federal government could more easily adopt a CBDC, which then may become the only viable digital currency.\"\n\nWhile the amendments certainly would \"make a CBDC easier to use **_for purposes of the UCC_**,\" as [the Cato Institute explains](https://www.cato.org/blog/ucc-paving-way-cbdc?ref=bitcoinbrief.io), \"that is still not to say a CBDC is being created through the UCC.\" Moreover, as Professor Carla Reyes [has pointed out](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4388919&ref=bitcoinbrief.io), the UCC amendments actually seek to \"preserve the negotiability of bitcoin ... in a way that should better enable individuals to freely transact in bitcoin without worry that they are taking the bitcoin subject to a secret lien.\" And, at the end of the day, a CBDC will still be legal tender under federal law, capable of discharging any debt, regardless of state commercial codes.\n\nSo, if states wish to insulate their economies and citizenry from the pernicious effects of CBDCs and promote financial freedom, focusing on the UCC is not the best policy.\n\nThis article proposes another solution. A mostly forgotten episode of monetary history offers a blueprint for states that wish to limit the spread of a federal CBDC. Not since the Civil War have states asserted their rights over monetary matters so forcefully. And no, I'm not talking about the confederacy. During the Civil War, California and Oregon effectively seceded from the monetary Union created by the \"greenbacks\" (paper fiat legal tender), yet remained in the political Union in the war against the confederacy. This was achieved through a combination of private contractual provisions and supportive legislative actions.\n\nMonetary Secession, Political Union\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn 1862, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the issuance of non-interest-bearing United States notes that were not redeemable in gold or silver specie, but were nonetheless \"legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States, except duties on imports and interest.\" (That the federal government still mandated gold for payment of duties demonstrates that it continued to value hard money, it just didn't have enough to wage a total war.) These notes came to be called \"greenbacks.\"\n\n![](https://www.bitcoinbrief.io/content/images/2023/04/US--1-LT-1862-Fr-16c--1-.jpg)\n\nA $1 Legal Tender Note from the Series 1862-1863 greenback issue. Source: National Museum of American History.\n\nThis was not the first instance of fiat paper money in the Republic (as I have detailed [here](https://www.bitcoinbrief.io/bitcoin-originalism-legal-tender/)). But it was the first time fiat had been issued by the federal government since the ratification of the Constitution. And it was also the first time the federal government declared anything other than gold and silver legal tender.\n\nIndeed, the constitution **does not** grant Congress an express power to declare legal tender. This power was first read-in to the constitution [by the Supreme Court](https://casetext.com/case/knox-v-lee?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) under the rationale that it was expedient during a time of war. But, as is often the case, temporary powers assumed by the government in times of crisis prove to be permanent. In 1884, the Supreme Court [declared](https://casetext.com/case/juilliard-v-greenman?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) that paper fiat greenbacks issued **after the war had ended** were constitutional.\n\nThe inflationary effect of fiat money on the Union states was felt almost immediately after the greenbacks were issued in 1862.\n\n![](https://www.bitcoinbrief.io/content/images/2023/04/crop1.png)\n\nSource: Arthur Nussbaum, A History of the Dollar 102-03 (1957).\n\nIn California, between June 13 and June 30th, 1862, the discount on greenbacks rose from 1-2% to 8%. By July the discount reached 15%. This new, inflationary currency only confirmed Californians' deeply held belief in hard money. Due to the gold rush, Californians used gold in their day-to-day lives. In fact, California's constitution forbade banks from issuing notes in California. Banks could only custody gold deposits.\\[[1](#footnote-1)\\]\n\nDespite its disdain for the federal government's fiat paper, California stayed loyal to the Union, and its courts recognized the greenbacks as constitutional legal tender.\\[[2](#footnote-2)\\]\n\nCalifornia merchants, however, forcefully resisted greenbacks. In San Francisco, meetings were held during which the majority of the merchants and businesses agreed not to accept greenbacks – and to blackball anyone that did. \"Greenback\" became a derogatory slur for anyone who attempted to discharge an honest debt with the depreciated paper (\"Greenback Smith\", \"Greenback Johnson\", etc.).\\[[3](#footnote-3)\\]\n\nMerchants then formalized their preference for gold by inserting **gold clauses** into their contracts, which provided for payment in gold or its equivalent. By operation of private contract, a tender of greenbacks was not recognized.\n\nWithout a law recognizing the validity of such clauses, however, the courts would not enforce them. Thus, the California legislature passed the \"**Specific Contract Act**,\" which directed courts to enforce gold clauses through \"specific performance\" by requiring delivery of the gold as stated in the gold clause, rather than merely entering a money judgment for an amount of dollars.\n\nThe operative provision of the Specific Contract Act read:\n\n> In an action on a contract or obligation in writing, for the direct payment of money, made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, judgment for the plaintiff, whether the same be by default or after verdict, may follow the contract or obligation, and be made payable in the kind of money or currency specified therein.\n\nThe Specific Contract Act simply recognized and enforced the right to contract for payment in any kind of money or currency agreed to between freely consenting parties. In the absence of a gold clause (or any other clause specifying kind of money for payment), greenbacks would be the default. Because the law merely acknowledged freedom of contract, and did not discriminate between types of money, it was able to skirt the constitutional scrutiny (the law didn't even reference greenbacks). The California Supreme Court [upheld](https://casetext.com/case/carpentier-v-atherton?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) the Specific Contract Act in 1864.\n\nOregon, Nevada, and Idaho followed California's lead and passed their own versions of the Specific Contract Act. Through the combination of private contractual provisions and legislative action, these western states were able to maintain their gold standard despite the federal government issuing paper fiat legal tender.\\[[4](#footnote-4)\\]\n\nAs Murray Rothbard [observed](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/a-history-of-money-and-banking-in-the-united-states.pdf?ref=bitcoinbrief.io#page=129):\n\n> This experience illustrates a continuing problem in contract law: It is not sufficient for government to allow contracts to be made in gold or gold coin. It is necessary for government to enforce specific performance of the contracts so that debtors must pay in the weight or value of the gold (or anything else) required in the contract, and not in some paper-dollar equivalent decided by law or the court.\\[[5](#footnote-5)\\]\n\n* * *\n\n_Find the Bitcoin Brief valuable?

Instead, it merely created a remedy in state courts for contractual claims that sought to enforce choice of payment. Financial freedom, backed by states' power to set contract law and court procedure, proved to be a \"[sly, roundabout way](https://youtu.be/nswOYo0zUcI?ref=bitcoinbrief.io)\" to take money out of the hands of the federal government.\n\nDirect state bans on a federal CBDC are not likely to succeed. To be sure, some courts (the [Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals](https://casetext.com/case/tennessee-scrap-recyclers-v-bredesen?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) and [Western District of New York](https://casetext.com/case/genesee-scrap-tin-baling-co-v-city-of-rochester?ref=bitcoinbrief.io)) have upheld state laws that proscribe the **method** of payment for certain services (in both cases, scrap metal sales). But those courts reasoned that the state laws specifying a method of payment did not violate the constitution's [prohibition on state legal tender laws](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/clause-1/?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) because the allowable methods of payment were still convertible to federal legal tender (checks, for example).\n\nIn contrast, a CBDC is not just a promise to pay legal tender, it is **itself** legal tender. Recall, CBDCs are direct liabilities of the central bank, just like dollar bills. A state law restricting acceptance of CBDCs in discharge of debts would encroach on the federal government's supreme powers over legal tender.\n\nThus, any law designed to limit CBDCs must do so obliquely. The California Specific Contracts Act did not mention gold, silver, greenbacks, or any other type of money. The law simply let freely contracting parties determine the type of payment for themselves. By facilitating freedom of choice in payments, states can promote a range of alternatives to CBDCs (including Bitcoin) through the natural market process.\n\nThat means, to be successful, any such legislation must support a pre-existing market of circulating CBDC alternatives.  Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho all had circular gold-based economies.  The legislatures of those states did not mandate a gold-standard or the prohibition of greenbacks, but simply backstopped the private market innovation of gold clauses with judicial recognition and enforcement.  \n\nBitcoiners must continue growing adoption and building out circular bitcoin-based economies.  By including bitcoin clauses like the gold clauses of the west, bitcoiners can ensure payment in their preferred medium of exchange.  Below, sample bitcoin clauses are offered as Premium Research content, based on actual gold clauses tested in court.\n\nAnd states should pass legislation requiring courts to enforce bitcoin clauses (or any clauses specifying type of money for payment) through _specific performance._  That means entering judgments requiring debtors to deliver the specified amount of bitcoin, rather than entering money judgments in dollar terms, which could be discharged by the use of legal tender, _i.e._, CBDCs. Below, sample legislative language is offered as Premium Research content.\n\nThe Feds Strike Back?\n---------------------\n\nAlthough successful in maintaining the gold-standard during the Civil War, the various state Specific Contract Laws were ultimately rendered dead-letter by the Roosevelt administration's war on gold at the outset of the great depression.  \n\nMany bitcoiners are familiar with FDR's April 5, 1933 Executive Order 6102 criminalizing private possession of gold.  (Indeed, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator [listed his birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) as April 5th.)  Less well-known, however, is Congress's joint resolution of June, 1933, which invalidated all gold clauses as contrary to public policy:\n\n![](https://www.bitcoinbrief.io/content/images/2023/04/joint-resolution.png)\n\nWhen Congress's abrogation of gold clauses reached the Supreme Court in a series of cases known as the Gold Clause Cases, it was one of the most anticipated and divisive decisions in U.S. history:\n\n> The decisions received significantly more coverage in the \\[New York\\] Times than did other major New Deal cases. For perspective, the number of articles devoted to them more closely resembles that of historic moments like the moon landing or 9/11 attacks than it did other major Supreme Court decisions such as Roe v. Wade. The phrase ‘‘gold clause’’ appeared in more Times articles (49) on the day after the decisions than did ‘‘poultry,’’ (10) ‘‘minimum wage,’’ (19) and ‘‘abortion’’ (15) combined, on the days after Schecter, West Coast Hotel, and Roe.\\[[6](#footnote-6)\\]\n\nThe Gold Clause Cases almost sparked a constitutional crisis. In anticipation of a decision declaring the gold clause abrogation unconstitutional, FDR prepared a draft \"fireside chat\" in which he would announce his intent to ignore the Supreme Court and implore the nation to do the same. \\[[7](#footnote-7)\\] And the _New York Times_ reported that \"Government officials and members of Congress 'were studying the possibility of increasing the membership of the Supreme Court from nine to eleven or twelve.'\" \\[[8](#footnote-8)\\] (The Supreme Court and FDR were frequently in conflict during the New Deal, and the Gold Clause Cases presaged the \"court packing plan\" and the \"[switch in time that saved nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_switch_in_time_that_saved_nine?ref=bitcoinbrief.io)\"). Ultimately, to avoid a crisis, the Supreme Court backed down and upheld Congress's abrogation of gold clauses.\n\nWould Congress similarly attempt to force acceptance of CBDCs by nullifying bitcoin clauses in all public and private contracts? While the Gold Clause Cases provide the federal government the legal precedent for such a maneuver, practically speaking, it would need a convergence of circumstances to pull it off.  \n\nFirst, and foremost, CBDCs would need to be in circulation.  It is unclear when, if ever, the federal government will turn to a fully digital dollar.  And the consensus appears to be that the Federal Reserve would need congressional approval before issuing a CBDC.\n\nSecond, the country would have to be deep in economic crisis and the federal government would have to feel that its CBDC is threatened.  FDR's attack on gold was acceptable due to the worsening depression.  Gold was an easy scapegoat for poor central bank policy.  \n\nThird, the executive and legislative branches would have to be closely aligned.  FDR had the support of a majority of the Senate and House;  the president essentially dictated whatever legislation he wanted.  This scenario seems unlikely to occur in our modern polarized, hyper-partisan times.  \n\nFourth, and finally, the federal government would need a subservient Supreme Court, or at least a Supreme Court prepared to make a \"strategic retreat.\" \\[[9](#footnote-9)\\]. Although the Gold Clause Cases are binding precedent, this current Supreme Court is not shy about overturning precedent the majority views as wrongly decided. It is possible the Supreme Court, if presented with a bitcoin abrogation clause case, would uphold the fundamental right to freedom of contract (especially because the Gold Clause Cases are broadly viewed as analytically weak).\n\nFor now, therefore, it appears bitcoin clauses and Specific Contract Laws are safe from federal preemption.  But any of the above circumstances are subject to change.  States and bitcoin advocates should act now while conditions are favorable.  If the shield of financial freedom and states' rights is erected before the Federal Reserve issues a CBDC, the American populace will be much less tolerant of draconian bans on alternative monetary assets, like Bitcoin.  \n\nNow is the time to work towards policies that will actually slow, and perhaps prevent, centralized overreach into our financial lives.\n\n* * *\n\nPremium Research\n----------------\n\n_If you'd like access to the following sample contract clauses and legislative language, just tap the \"Premium Research\" button and pay the bitcoin lighting invoice that pops up with your lighting wallet._  \n\n_If you don't have a lighting wallet or bitcoin, download Cash App and buy a few dollars in the \"money\" tab.  Then tap the QR scanner in the top right of the \"Bitcoin\" screen and scan the QR code displayed on the invoice after tapping the \"Premium Research\" button._\n\n_These samples are for discussion and educational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice._\n\n### Sample Bitcoin Clauses\n\nThe California Supreme Court in [Lane v. Gluckauf](https://casetext.com/case/lane-v-gluckauf?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) held that the following clause triggered the Specific Contracts Law:  \n\n> I promise to pay ... the sum of $2843 in gold coin of the standard value of 1860 of the United States of America ... and if said principal and interest is not paid in gold coin ... then I promise ... to pay ... in addition thereto and as damages, such further amount and percentage as may be equal to the difference in value in the San Francisco market between such gold coin and paper evidence of indebtedness of the States or of the United States, that are or may hereafter be made a legal tender in payment of debts by the laws of this state or the United States.\n\nIn contrast, the California Supreme Court in [Reese v. Stearns](https://casetext.com/case/reese-v-stearns?ref=bitcoinbrief.io) held that a clause merely requiring payment _in gold or its equivalent_ **did not** trigger the Specific Contracts Law, because it provided no standard of camparison between gold dollars and paper dollars. This issue of determining the amount of gold to be paid in the contract is unique to the situation in 1862, where two types of dollars circulated using the same unit of account (gold coin dollars comprising a specific weight, and paper greenbacks). The gold clauses did not, therefore, specify a weight of gold to be paid, but instead specified a standard gold dollar value as of a certain time and place (in the above example, 1860 and San Francisco).\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has its own unit of account (which is divisable into smaller units of 100,000,000 satoshis per bitcoin), and so a bitcoin clause would not require reference to a specific conversion rate. For example, a bitcoin clause could simply state:  \n\n> payment shall be made in bitcoin in the amount of 10,000,000 sats (0.10 btc)\n\nSuch a clause is straightforward. But it's useful only if both parties are already on a bitcoin standard and denominating expenses, liabilities, products, and services in bitcoin. What if one or both parties are not yet on a bitcoin standard?\n\nIn that case, the parties could use a variation of the clause in Lane v. Gluckauf:\n\n> payment shall be $2750 in bitcoin of the standard value of \\[date of agreement\\], and if said payment is not paid in bitcoin then I promise to pay, in addition thereto and as damages, such further amount as may be equal to the difference between $2750 in bitcoin of the standard value of \\[date of agreement\\] and bitcoin of the standard value as of the date of tender.\n\nUnder this variation of bitcoin clause, if $2750 would buy 10,000,000 sats (0.10 btc) on the date of the agreement, then 10,000,000 sats will discharge the debt. If, on the date of tender, the price of bitcoin has increased in U.S. dollar terms such that 10,000,000 sats is now worth $3000, the debtor/obligor could not discharge the debt for $2750 in U.S. dollars. A dollar tender would, in fact, be a breach of the agreement, entitling the creditor/obligee to damages amounting to $2750 plus the difference in the value of bitcoin between the date of the agreement and date of tender. This would make the creditor/obligee whole, in bitcoin terms (they could go purchase 10,000,000 sats with the $3000).\n\nThese examples are merely a starting point for discussion purposes, based on research into historical gold clauses (and are **not** legal advice; consult an attorney before using any of the above). The purpose of these clauses is to be compatible with Specific Contracts Laws, as proposed below. Please contact me with thoughts, critiques, or variations on these bitcoin clauses. I am interested in learning how bitcoin businesses are currently structuring their contracts, and whether current practice would trigger application of Specific Contracts Laws.\n\n### Sample Legislative Language\n\nCalifornia's Specific Contracts law stated:  \n\n> In an action on a contract or obligation in writing, for the direct payment of money, made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, judgment for the plaintiff, whether the same be by default or after verdict, may follow the contract or obligation, and be made payable in the kind of money or currency specified therein.\n\nA few tweaks are required to reflect modern judicial procedure and clarify the intent:\n\n> In an action on a contract or obligation for the direct payment of money, made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, judgment for the plaintiff shall be entered in the kind of money or currency specified therein. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a plaintiff's right to seek specific performance for the delivery of the kind of money or currency specified in the contract or obligation.\n\nThis proposed language removes the requirement that a contract be in writing (as oral agreements are recognizable under law), thereby broadening the scope of any modern Specific Contract Law.\n\nThe language also subsitutes \"may\" for \"shall\" in its directions to the courts, as \"may\" in modern usage is permissive and would afford too much discretion to the courts to enter judgments that did not follow the contract.\n\nAnd the language is more specific about what a court is to do, i.e., enter a judgment in terms of the currency or money agreed to by contract. This would confer on the plaintiff a money judgment, not just an order to tender the contracted-for currency. A money judgment is executable against other assets of the judgment-debtor and comes with additional safeguards for judgment-creditors (like bonds pending appeal).\n\nFinally, although this proposed language would, by default, result in a money judgment, it includes language clarifying that a plaintiff can still seek specific performance of a contractual provision for payment in a specific kind of money. This gives the plaintiff the option in their complaint to seek both a money judgment and, in the alternative, an order granting specific performance, compelling the judgment-debtor to hand over the specific type of money. This option may be preferable under certain circumstances, and a Specific Contracts Law should maintain that common law right while also guaranteeing a right to a money judgment in money other than dollars.\n\nAgain, this example is merely a starting point for discussions (and does not constitute legal advice). The goal is to prevent money judgments on bitcoin contracts being denominated and enforced in CBDC dollars.

As interest in the concept of \"states' rights\" reaches an all-time high, states are exploring bills to limit the use of the federal government's proposed central bank digital currency, or CBDC.Google Trends: Interest in \"States Rights\"CBDCs are fully digital currencies issued directly by central banks to citizens. Like paper dollars, CBDCs are central bank liabilities. But unlike paper dollars, which provide high levels of financial privacy, CBDCs undermine the individual right to privacy by giving \"the federal government complete visibility into every financial transaction by establishing a direct link between the government and each citizens’ financial activity.\"CBDCs combine this mass surveillance capability with programmability, creating the frightening potential to restrict purchases of certain goods and services to achieve policy goals (for example, preventing SNAP recipients from buying alcohol; rationing gasoline, propane, or even meat to fight climate change; imposing spending limits on ammunition or prohibiting the purchase of certain types of firearms; preventing spending on reproductive health or medical marijuana/psychedelics). CBDCs will also give the central bank levers of fine-tuned economic control, by, for example, incentivizing spending or saving at the individual level through dollars with expiration dates.In other words, CBDCs are a central planner's dream come true. Indeed, the CCP in China is pioneering them.Both Florida and North Dakota have asserted their sovereign powers over trade and commerce within their borders to resist this application of federal power over money. Specifically, both states have opposed amending their respective commercial codes to include new definitions of \"money\" proposed in the Uniform Commercial Code (drafted by a private body of attorneys and lawmakers that crafts model codes to promote uniformity across states). The governors of these two states believe the proposed amendments will pave the way for CBDCs by including government-issued digital currencies in the definition of \"money\", while at the same time excluding non-governmental digital currencies like Bitcoin.The governor of Florida, Ron Desantis, has advocated for a law that would preclude recognizing CBDCs as \"money\" in Florida's commercial code. As his office explained it:The legislative proposal protects consumers and businesses from a federally controlled CBDC by:Expressly prohibiting the use of a federally adopted Central Bank Digital Currency as money within Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).Instituting protections against a central global currency by prohibiting any CBDC issued by a foreign reserve or foreign sanctioned central bank.Calling on likeminded states to join Florida in adopting similar prohibitions within their respective Commercial Codes to fight back against this concept nationwide.And Governor Kristi Noem of North Dakota vetoed the UCC amendments passed by the state's legislature, stating her belief that the amendments \"open[] the door to the risk that the federal government could more easily adopt a CBDC, which then may become the only viable digital currency.\"\n\nWhile the amendments certainly would \"make a CBDC easier to use for purposes of the UCC,\" as the Cato Institute explains, \"that is still not to say a CBDC is being created through the UCC.\" Moreover, as Professor Carla Reyes has pointed out, the UCC amendments actually seek to \"preserve the negotiability of bitcoin ... in a way that should better enable individuals to freely transact in bitcoin without worry that they are taking the bitcoin subject to a secret lien.\" And, at the end of the day, a CBDC will still be legal tender under federal law, capable of discharging any debt, regardless of state commercial codes.So, if states wish to insulate their economies and citizenry from the pernicious effects of CBDCs and promote financial freedom, focusing on the UCC is not the best policy.This article proposes another solution. A mostly forgotten episode of monetary history offers a blueprint for states that wish to limit the spread of a federal CBDC. Not since the Civil War have states asserted their rights over monetary matters so forcefully. And no, I'm not talking about the confederacy. During the Civil War, California and Oregon effectively seceded from the monetary Union created by the \"greenbacks\" (paper fiat legal tender), yet remained in the political Union in the war against the confederacy. This was achieved through a combination of private contractual provisions and supportive legislative actions.Monetary Secession, Political UnionIn 1862, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the issuance of non-interest-bearing United States notes that were not redeemable in gold or silver specie, but were nonetheless \"legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States, except duties on imports and interest.\" (That the federal government still mandated gold for payment of duties demonstrates that it continued to value hard money, it just didn't have enough to wage a total war.) These notes came to be called \"greenbacks.\"A $1 Legal Tender Note from the Series 1862-1863 greenback issue. Source: National Museum of American History.This was not the first instance of fiat paper money in the Republic (as I have detailed here). But it was the first time fiat had been issued by the federal government since the ratification of the Constitution. And it was also the first time the federal government declared anything other than gold and silver legal tender.Indeed, the constitution does not grant Congress an express power to declare legal tender. This power was first read-in to the constitution by the Supreme Court under the rationale that it was expedient during a time of war. But, as is often the case, temporary powers assumed by the government in times of crisis prove to be permanent. In 1884, the Supreme Court declared that paper fiat greenbacks issued after the war had ended were constitutional. The inflationary effect of fiat money on the Union states was felt almost immediately after the greenbacks were issued in 1862.Source: Arthur Nussbaum, A History of the Dollar 102-03 (1957).\nIn California, between June 13 and June 30th, 1862, the discount on greenbacks rose from 1-2% to 8%. By July the discount reached 15%.  This new, inflationary currency only confirmed Californians' deeply held belief in hard money. Due to the gold rush, Californians used gold in their day-to-day lives. In fact, California's constitution forbade banks from issuing notes in California.  Banks could only custody gold deposits.[1]\nDespite its disdain for the federal government's fiat paper, California stayed loyal to the Union, and its courts recognized the greenbacks as constitutional legal tender.[2]California merchants, however, forcefully resisted greenbacks. In San Francisco, meetings were held during which the majority of the merchants and businesses agreed not to accept greenbacks – and to blackball anyone that did.  \"Greenback\" became a derogatory slur for anyone who attempted to discharge an honest debt with the depreciated paper (\"Greenback Smith\", \"Greenback Johnson\", etc.).[3]Merchants then formalized their preference for gold by inserting gold clauses into their contracts, which provided for payment in gold or its equivalent. By operation of private contract, a tender of greenbacks was not recognized.Without a law recognizing the validity of such clauses, however, the courts would not enforce them. Thus, the California legislature passed the \"Specific Contract Act,\" which directed courts to enforce gold clauses through \"specific performance\" by requiring delivery of the gold as stated in the gold clause, rather than merely entering a money judgment for an amount of dollars.The operative provision of the Specific Contract Act read:\n    In an action on a contract or obligation in writing, for the direct payment of money, made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, judgment for the plaintiff, whether the same be by default or after verdict, may follow the contract or obligation, and be made payable in the kind of money or currency specified therein.\n    \n  The Specific Contract Act simply recognized and enforced the right to contract for payment in any kind of money or currency agreed to between freely consenting parties. In the absence of a gold clause (or any other clause specifying kind of money for payment), greenbacks would be the default. Because the law merely acknowledged freedom of contract, and did not discriminate between types of money, it was able to skirt the constitutional scrutiny (the law didn't even reference greenbacks). The California Supreme Court upheld the Specific Contract Act in 1864. Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho followed California's lead and passed their own versions of the Specific Contract Act.  Through the combination of private contractual provisions and legislative action, these western states were able to maintain their gold standard despite the federal government issuing paper fiat legal tender.[4]As Murray Rothbard observed:\nThis experience illustrates a continuing problem in contract law: It is not sufficient for government to allow contracts to be made in gold or gold coin. It is necessary for government to enforce specific performance of the contracts so that debtors must pay in the weight or value of the gold (or anything else) required in the contract, and not in some paper-dollar equivalent decided by law or the court.[5] Find the Bitcoin Brief valuable?

Instead, it merely created a remedy in state courts for contractual claims that sought to enforce choice of payment. Financial freedom, backed by states' power to set contract law and court procedure, proved to be a \"sly, roundabout way\" to take money out of the hands of the federal government.Direct state bans on a federal CBDC are not likely to succeed. To be sure, some courts (the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Western District of New York) have upheld state laws that proscribe the method of payment for certain services (in both cases, scrap metal sales). But those courts reasoned that the state laws specifying a method of payment did not violate the constitution's prohibition on state legal tender laws because the allowable methods of payment were still convertible to federal legal tender (checks, for example).In contrast, a CBDC is not just a promise to pay legal tender, it is itself legal tender. Recall, CBDCs are direct liabilities of the central bank, just like dollar bills. A state law restricting acceptance of CBDCs in discharge of debts would encroach on the federal government's supreme powers over legal tender.Thus, any law designed to limit CBDCs must do so obliquely. The California Specific Contracts Act did not mention gold, silver, greenbacks, or any other type of money. The law simply let freely contracting parties determine the type of payment for themselves. By facilitating freedom of choice in payments, states can promote a range of alternatives to CBDCs (including Bitcoin) through the natural market process.That means, to be successful, any such legislation must support a pre-existing market of circulating CBDC alternatives.  Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho all had circular gold-based economies.  The legislatures of those states did not mandate a gold-standard or the prohibition of greenbacks, but simply backstopped the private market innovation of gold clauses with judicial recognition and enforcement.  Bitcoiners must continue growing adoption and building out circular bitcoin-based economies.  By including bitcoin clauses like the gold clauses of the west, bitcoiners can ensure payment in their preferred medium of exchange.  Below, sample bitcoin clauses are offered as Premium Research content, based on actual gold clauses tested in court. And states should pass legislation requiring courts to enforce bitcoin clauses (or any clauses specifying type of money for payment) through specific performance.  That means entering judgments requiring debtors to deliver the specified amount of bitcoin, rather than entering money judgments in dollar terms, which could be discharged by the use of legal tender, i.e., CBDCs. Below, sample legislative language is offered as Premium Research content.The Feds Strike Back?Although successful in maintaining the gold-standard during the Civil War, the various state Specific Contract Laws were ultimately rendered dead-letter by the Roosevelt administration's war on gold at the outset of the great depression.  Many bitcoiners are familiar with FDR's April 5, 1933 Executive Order 6102 criminalizing private possession of gold.  (Indeed, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator listed his birthday as April 5th.)  Less well-known, however, is Congress's joint resolution of June, 1933, which invalidated all gold clauses as contrary to public policy:\n    \n      \n    \n  When Congress's abrogation of gold clauses reached the Supreme Court in a series of cases known as the Gold Clause Cases, it was one of the most anticipated and divisive decisions in U.S. history:\nThe decisions received significantly more coverage in the [New York] Times than did other major New Deal cases. For perspective, the number of articles devoted to them more closely resembles that of historic moments like the moon landing or 9/11 attacks than it did other major Supreme Court decisions such as Roe v. Wade. The phrase ‘‘gold clause’’ appeared in more Times articles (49) on the day after the decisions than did ‘‘poultry,’’ (10) ‘‘minimum wage,’’ (19) and ‘‘abortion’’ (15) combined, on the days after Schecter, West Coast Hotel, and Roe.[6]\nThe Gold Clause Cases almost sparked a constitutional crisis.  In anticipation of a decision declaring the gold clause abrogation unconstitutional, FDR prepared a draft \"fireside chat\" in which he would announce his intent to ignore the Supreme Court and implore the nation to do the same.  [7]  And the New York Times reported that \"Government officials and members of Congress 'were studying the possibility of increasing the membership of the Supreme Court from nine to eleven or twelve.'\" [8]  (The Supreme Court and FDR were frequently in conflict during the New Deal, and the Gold Clause Cases presaged the \"court packing plan\" and the \"switch in time that saved nine\").  Ultimately, to avoid a crisis, the Supreme Court backed down and upheld Congress's abrogation of gold clauses.\n\nWould Congress similarly attempt to force acceptance of CBDCs by nullifying bitcoin clauses in all public and private contracts? While the Gold Clause Cases provide the federal government the legal precedent for such a maneuver, practically speaking, it would need a convergence of circumstances to pull it off.  First, and foremost, CBDCs would need to be in circulation.  It is unclear when, if ever, the federal government will turn to a fully digital dollar.  And the consensus appears to be that the Federal Reserve would need congressional approval before issuing a CBDC.Second, the country would have to be deep in economic crisis and the federal government would have to feel that its CBDC is threatened.  FDR's attack on gold was acceptable due to the worsening depression.  Gold was an easy scapegoat for poor central bank policy.  Third, the executive and legislative branches would have to be closely aligned.  FDR had the support of a majority of the Senate and House;  the president essentially dictated whatever legislation he wanted.  This scenario seems unlikely to occur in our modern polarized, hyper-partisan times.  Fourth, and finally, the federal government would need a subservient Supreme Court, or at least a Supreme Court prepared to make a \"strategic retreat.\"  [9].  Although the Gold Clause Cases are binding precedent, this current Supreme Court is not shy about overturning precedent the majority views as wrongly decided.  It is possible the Supreme Court, if presented with a bitcoin abrogation clause case, would uphold the fundamental right to freedom of contract (especially because the Gold Clause Cases are broadly viewed as analytically weak).For now, therefore, it appears bitcoin clauses and Specific Contract Laws are safe from federal preemption.  But any of the above circumstances are subject to change.  States and bitcoin advocates should act now while conditions are favorable.  If the shield of financial freedom and states' rights is erected before the Federal Reserve issues a CBDC, the American populace will be much less tolerant of draconian bans on alternative monetary assets, like Bitcoin.  Now is the time to work towards policies that will actually slow, and perhaps prevent, centralized overreach into our financial lives.Premium ResearchIf you'd like access to the following sample contract clauses and legislative language, just tap the \"Premium Research\" button and pay the bitcoin lighting invoice that pops up with your lighting wallet.  If you don't have a lighting wallet or bitcoin, download Cash App and buy a few dollars in the \"money\" tab.  Then tap the QR scanner in the top right of the \"Bitcoin\" screen and scan the QR code displayed on the invoice after tapping the \"Premium Research\" button.These samples are for discussion and educational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice.\nSample Bitcoin Clauses\n     The California Supreme Court in Lane v. Gluckauf held that the following clause triggered the Specific Contracts Law:\n    \tI promise to pay ... the sum of $2843 in gold coin of the standard value of 1860 of the United States of America ... and if said principal and interest is not paid in gold coin ... then I promise ... to pay ... in addition thereto and as damages, such further amount and percentage as may be equal to the difference in value in the San Francisco market between such gold coin and paper evidence of indebtedness of the States or of the United States, that are or may hereafter be made a legal tender in payment of debts by the laws of this state or the United States.  \t\t\t\t\t\n    \n\tIn contrast, the California Supreme Court in Reese v. Stearns held that a clause merely requiring payment in gold or its equivalent did not trigger the Specific Contracts Law, because it provided no standard of camparison between gold dollars and paper dollars.  This issue of determining the amount of gold to be paid in the contract is unique to the situation in 1862, where two types of dollars circulated using the same unit of account (gold coin dollars comprising a specific weight, and paper greenbacks).  The gold clauses did not, therefore, specify a weight of gold to be paid, but instead specified a standard gold dollar value as of a certain time and place (in the above example, 1860 and San Francisco).\n\t\n\tBitcoin, on the other hand, has its own unit of account (which is divisable into smaller units of 100,000,000 satoshis per bitcoin), and so a bitcoin clause would not require reference to a specific conversion rate. For example, a bitcoin clause could simply state:\npayment shall be made in bitcoin in the amount of 10,000,000 sats (0.10 btc)\n\tSuch a clause is straightforward.  But it's useful only if both parties are already on a bitcoin standard and denominating expenses, liabilities, products, and services in bitcoin.  What if one or both parties are not yet on a bitcoin standard?\n\tIn that case, the parties could use a variation of the clause in Lane v. Gluckauf:\n        payment shall be $2750 in bitcoin of the standard value of [date of agreement], and if said payment is not paid in bitcoin then I promise to pay, in addition thereto and as damages, such further amount as may be equal to the difference between $2750 in bitcoin of the standard value of [date of agreement] and bitcoin of the standard value as of the date of tender.\n     Under this variation of bitcoin clause, if $2750 would buy 10,000,000 sats (0.10 btc) on the date of the agreement, then 10,000,000 sats will discharge the debt.  If, on the date of tender, the price of bitcoin has increased in U.S. dollar terms such that 10,000,000 sats is now worth $3000, the debtor/obligor could not discharge the debt for $2750 in U.S. dollars.  A dollar tender would, in fact, be a breach of the agreement, entitling the creditor/obligee to damages amounting to $2750 plus the difference in the value of bitcoin between the date of the agreement and date of tender.  This would make the creditor/obligee whole, in bitcoin terms (they could go purchase 10,000,000 sats with the $3000).\nThese examples are merely a starting point for discussion purposes, based on research into historical gold clauses (and are not legal advice; consult an attorney before using any of the above).  The purpose of these clauses is to be compatible with Specific Contracts Laws, as proposed below.  Please contact me with thoughts, critiques, or variations on these bitcoin clauses.  I am interested in learning how bitcoin businesses are currently structuring their contracts, and whether current practice would trigger application of Specific Contracts Laws.\n  Sample Legislative Language\n\tCalifornia's Specific Contracts law stated:\n        In an action on a contract or obligation in writing, for the direct payment of money, made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, judgment for the plaintiff, whether the same be by default or after verdict, may follow the contract or obligation, and be made payable in the kind of money or currency specified therein.\n    \n\tA few tweaks are required to reflect modern judicial procedure and clarify the intent:\n        In an action on a contract or obligation for the direct payment of money, made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, judgment for the plaintiff shall be entered in the kind of money or currency specified therein.  Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a plaintiff's right to seek specific performance for the delivery of the kind of money or currency specified in the contract or obligation.\n    This proposed language removes the requirement that a contract be in writing (as oral agreements are recognizable under law), thereby broadening the scope of any modern Specific Contract Law.\n    The language also subsitutes \"may\" for \"shall\" in its directions to the courts, as \"may\" in modern usage is permissive and would afford too much discretion to the courts to enter judgments that did not follow the contract.  \n    And the language is more specific about what a court is to do, i.e., enter a judgment in terms of the currency or money agreed to by contract.  This would confer on the plaintiff a money judgment, not just an order to tender the contracted-for currency.  A money judgment is executable against other assets of the judgment-debtor and comes with additional safeguards for judgment-creditors (like bonds pending appeal).\n    Finally, although this proposed language would, by default, result in a money judgment, it includes language clarifying that a plaintiff can still seek specific performance of a contractual provision for payment in a specific kind of money.  This gives the plaintiff the option in their complaint to seek both a money judgment and, in the alternative, an order granting specific performance, compelling the judgment-debtor to hand over the specific type of money.  This option may be preferable under certain circumstances, and a Specific Contracts Law should maintain that common law right while also guaranteeing a right to a money judgment in money other than dollars.\n    Again, this example is merely a starting point for discussions (and does not constitute legal advice).  The goal is to prevent money judgments on bitcoin contracts being denominated and enforced in CBDC dollars.  By instructing courts that they must enter judgment in the type of money specified by contract, individuals who wish to opt out of a federal CBDC can do so while maintaining protections under state contract law.\n    Please reach out to me with comments, questions, suggestions and critiques to the proposed language.  Lets work together towards policies that will actually slow, and perhaps prevent, centralized overreach into our financial lives.\nFootnotes[1] A History of the California Supreme Court, 1850-1879, Vol. 14 J.

He is known as the destroyer while the other gods are the creator (Brahma) and the preserver ([Vishnu](https://mythology.net/hindu/hindu-gods/vishnu/ \"Vishnu\")). While the other gods are responsible for the creation and perseverance of the earth, Shiva must destroy it in order to recreate it.\n\nRoles and Powers\n----------------\n\nShiva has many roles and powers. He is known to haunt cemeteries while wearing a headdress of snakes and a necklace full of skulls. But he is also helpful to mortals and fellow gods. He acts as a judge, rewarding the good and showing no mercy to the bad. He spends much of his time in deep meditation as he gains spiritual strength. He showed his willingness to sacrifice himself for others when he swallowed the poison of Vasuki, a [serpent](https://mythology.net/others/concepts/serpent/ \"serpent\") used to produce water of life by the gods. Drinking this poison turned Shiva’s neck blue forever but he saved the world from destruction.\n\nOne of Shiva’s largest responsibilities is to dance. His dancing symbolizes truth and is meant to rid the world of ignorance and help to end the suffering from those who worship him.\n\nLegends and Stories\n-------------------\n\nAs one of the supreme gods, there are many myths surrounding Shiva. Here are just a couple.\n\n### Birth of Shiva\n\nThere are a few different myths that claim to explain the existence of Shiva but this is the most popular. According to the myth, Brahma and Vishnu were having an argument. They each thought that they were the strongest god. Suddenly, in the middle of the argument, a blazing pillar suddenly appeared. Its branches and roots reached farther than the ends of the earth and heavens. Brahma transformed himself into a goose and flew to the tip top of the pillar, but he could not find it. Vishnu transformed into a boar and tunneled through the earth to find the roots of the pillar. Neither of the gods could find the end of the top or bottom. They returned to where they started just in time to see Shiva appeared from the inside of the pillar. They immediately knew that Shiva had great power and they immediately knew he was an equal and fellow ruler of the universe.\n\n### The Dance\n\nShiva is sometimes called the Lord of Dance. It is said that the rhythm of dance serves as a metaphor for the balance of the universe. The Tandav is his most important dance. It is known as the cosmic dance of death and it is only to be performed when the universe needs to be destroyed.\n\nOne day, there was to be a prayer ceremony with all the gods. Offerings were to be made but Shiva was not invited. He had married Sati, the daughter of the party’s host, and was being punished. Sati was upset that her husband was being disrespected and intensely prayed before jumping into the fire burning at the ceremony. Shiva, even though he wasn’t present, immediately knew what had happened and became angry.\n\nHe was so upset that he began the dance meant to end the universe. The gods who were present at the ceremony tried to calm down Shiva. They scattered the ashes of his wife over the dancing god, which stopped Shiva from completing the dance. Instead, he went into a deep meditation in memory of his wife. He ignored all of his other duties while he grieved.\n\nSati was eventually reborn as Parvati. Shiva came out of his meditation and grief. The two went on to have a marriage full of love and patience.\n\nFamily\n------\n\nShiva is said to have appeared from a giant blazing pillar and does not have parents. Devi, the Mother-goddess, is Shiva’s consort, though she is also Sati and Parvati. It is believed that they live in the Himalayas in the Kailash mountains.\n\nAppearance\n----------\n\nShiva is usually shown in a yogic position. He has a blue face and throat while his body is either white or blue, depending on the artistic representation. He has a third eye, which represents his insight and wisdom. Some believe that the extra eye holds onto his untamed energy. Shiva was once distracted while worshipping by Kama, the love god. It is said that Shiva opened his third eye out of anger and Kama was immediately consumed by fire.\n\nShiva is also shown with a cobra necklace that signifies his power over dangerous creatures.

He is known as the destroyer while the other gods are the creator (Brahma) and the preserver (Vishnu). While the other gods are responsible for the creation and perseverance of the earth, Shiva must destroy it in order to recreate it.Roles and Powers\nShiva has many roles and powers. He is known to haunt cemeteries while wearing a headdress of snakes and a necklace full of skulls. But he is also helpful to mortals and fellow gods. He acts as a judge, rewarding the good and showing no mercy to the bad. He spends much of his time in deep meditation as he gains spiritual strength. He showed his willingness to sacrifice himself for others when he swallowed the poison of Vasuki, a serpent used to produce water of life by the gods. Drinking this poison turned Shiva’s neck blue forever but he saved the world from destruction.\nOne of Shiva’s largest responsibilities is to dance. His dancing symbolizes truth and is meant to rid the world of ignorance and help to end the suffering from those who worship him.\nLegends and Stories\nAs one of the supreme gods, there are many myths surrounding Shiva. Here are just a couple.\nBirth of Shiva\nThere are a few different myths that claim to explain the existence of Shiva but this is the most popular. According to the myth, Brahma and Vishnu were having an argument. They each thought that they were the strongest god. Suddenly, in the middle of the argument, a blazing pillar suddenly appeared. Its branches and roots reached farther than the ends of the earth and heavens. Brahma transformed himself into a goose and flew to the tip top of the pillar, but he could not find it. Vishnu transformed into a boar and tunneled through the earth to find the roots of the pillar. Neither of the gods could find the end of the top or bottom. They returned to where they started just in time to see Shiva appeared from the inside of the pillar. They immediately knew that Shiva had great power and they immediately knew he was an equal and fellow ruler of the universe.The Dance\nShiva is sometimes called the Lord of Dance. It is said that the rhythm of dance serves as a metaphor for the balance of the universe. The Tandav is his most important dance. It is known as the cosmic dance of death and it is only to be performed when the universe needs to be destroyed.\nOne day, there was to be a prayer ceremony with all the gods. Offerings were to be made but Shiva was not invited. He had married Sati, the daughter of the party’s host, and was being punished. Sati was upset that her husband was being disrespected and intensely prayed before jumping into the fire burning at the ceremony. Shiva, even though he wasn’t present, immediately knew what had happened and became angry.\nHe was so upset that he began the dance meant to end the universe. The gods who were present at the ceremony tried to calm down Shiva. They scattered the ashes of his wife over the dancing god, which stopped Shiva from completing the dance. Instead, he went into a deep meditation in memory of his wife. He ignored all of his other duties while he grieved.\nSati was eventually reborn as Parvati. Shiva came out of his meditation and grief. The two went on to have a marriage full of love and patience.\nFamily\nShiva is said to have appeared from a giant blazing pillar and does not have parents. Devi, the Mother-goddess, is Shiva’s consort, though she is also Sati and Parvati. It is believed that they live in the Himalayas in the Kailash mountains.\nAppearance\nShiva is usually shown in a yogic position. He has a blue face and throat while his body is either white or blue, depending on the artistic representation. He has a third eye, which represents his insight and wisdom. Some believe that the extra eye holds onto his untamed energy. Shiva was once distracted while worshipping by Kama, the love god. It is said that Shiva opened his third eye out of anger and Kama was immediately consumed by fire.\nShiva is also shown with a cobra necklace that signifies his power over dangerous creatures. It is also said that the cobra symbolizes Shiva’s power of destruction. Just as the snake sheds its skin to make way for new skin, Shiva destroys to make room for recreation.\nShiva is also shown with a trident, which represents the three functions of the Hindu triumvirate. It should also be noted that while other gods are shown with lavish clothing and belongings, Shiva is usually shown with simple clothing and backgrounds. But his wife is usually shown on the side of him as their relationship is equal. Shiva is also shown as a smiling and tranquil god, despite being the destroyer.\nSymbology\nBesides the symbology mentioned in the previous section, there are a few other symbols to remember about Shiva. His half-open eyes are said to symbolize the cycle of the universe. When he opens his eyes, a new cycle of creation starts. But if he ever closes them, this is the start of the end of the universe.\nThere are three lines of ashes on Shiva’s forehead. They are known as the Vighuti and are meant to symbolize the immortality of Shiva and his manifested glory. Shiva is usually shown wearing the skin of an elephant and deer. The elephant skin represents pride while the deer skin symbolizes the flickering mind. Wearing both shows that Shiva has conquered both vices.\nShiva also wears a necklace made from 108 beads formed from seeds of the Rudraska tree. The beads are said to represent all the elements used in the creation of the world. The necklace illustrates how Shiva is firm in his laws and strictly maintains law and order."],["length","5835"],["r","https://zapworthy.com/load?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmythology.net%2Fhindu%2Fhindu-gods%2Fshiva%2F"],["published_at","1682463658"]]}]"###)

Here is a [link to the audio](https://dergigi.com/assets/audio/reader.ogg) instead.\n\nRead by [Guy Swann](https://twitter.com/TheGuySwann).\n\n* * *\n\nNot too long ago, I tried to paint a picture of what a [vision for a value-enabled web](https://dergigi.com/vew) could look like. Now, only a couple of months later, all this stuff is being built. On nostr, and on lightning. Orange and purple, a match made in heaven.\n\nIt goes without saying that I’m beyond delighted. What a time to be alive!\n\n### nostr\n\nHere’s the thing that nostr got right, and it’s the same thing that Bitcoin got right: information is easy to spread and hard to stifle.[1](#fn:fn-stifle) Information can be copied quickly and perfectly, which is, I believe, the underlying reason for its desire to be free.\n\nEasy to spread, hard to stifle. That’s the base reality of the nature of information. As always, the smart thing is to work with nature, not against it.[2](#fn:1) That’s what’s beautiful about the orange coin and the purple ostrich: both manage to work with the peculiarities of information, not against them. Both realize that information can and should be copied, as it can be perfectly read and easily spread, always. Both understand that resistance to censorship comes from writing to many places, making the cost of deletion prohibitive.\n\n> Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor’s younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.\n> \n> Eric Hughes, [A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt)\n\nNostr is quickly establishing itself as a base layer for information exchange, one that is identity-native and value-enabled. It is distinctly different from systems that came before it, just like Bitcoin is distinctly different from monies that came before it.\n\nAs of today, the focus of nostr is mostly on short text notes, the so-called “type 1” events more commonly known as _tweets_.[3](#fn:fn-kinds) However, as you should be aware by now, nostr is way more than just an alternative to twitter. It is a new paradigm. Change the note kind from `1` to `30023` and you don’t have an alternative to Twitter, but a replacement for Medium, Substack, and all the other long-form platforms. I believe that special-purpose clients that focus on certain content types will emerge over time, just like we have seen the emergence of special-purpose platforms in the Web 2.0 era. This time, however, the network effects are cumulative, not separate. A new paradigm.\n\nLet me now turn to one such special-purpose client, a nostr-based reading app.\n\n### Reading\n\nI’m constantly surprised that, even though most people do read a lot online, very few people seem to have a reading workflow or reading tools.\n\nWhy that is is anyone’s guess, but maybe the added value of such tools is not readily apparent. You can just read the stuff right there, on the ad-ridden, dead-ugly site, right? Why should you sign up for another site, use another app, or bind yourself to another closed platform?\n\nThat’s a fair point, but the success of Medium and Substack shows that there is an appetite for clean reading and writing, as well as providing avenues for authors to get paid for their writing (and a willingness of readers to support said authors, just because).\n\nThe problem is, of course, that all of these platforms are _platforms_, which is to say, walled gardens that imprison readers and writers alike. Worse than that: they are fiat platforms, which means that permissionless value-flows are not only absent from their DNA, they are outright impossible.[4](#fn:2)\n\nNostr fixes this.\n\n![](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/nostrich-reading-a-newspaper.jpg)\n\nThe beauty of nostr is that it is not a platform. It’s a protocol, which means that you don’t have to sign up for it—you can create an identity yourself. You don’t have to ask for permission; you just _do_, without having to rely on the benevolence of whatever dictator is in charge of the platform right now.\n\nNostr is _not_ a platform, and yet, powerful tools and services can be built and monetized on top of it. This is good for users, good for service providers, and good for the network(s) at large. Win-win-win.\n\nSo what am I talking about, exactly? How can nostr improve everyone’s reading (and writing) experience?\n\nAllow me to paint a (rough) picture of what I have in mind. Nostr already supports private and public bookmarks, so let’s start from there.\n\nImagine a special-purpose client that scans all your bookmarks for long-form content.[5](#fn:fn-urls) Everything that you marked to be read later is shown in an orderly fashion, which is to say searchable, sortable, filterable, and displayed without distractions. Voilà, you have yourself a reading app. That’s, in essence, how Pocket, Readwise, and other reading apps work. But all these apps are walled gardens without much interoperability and without direct monetization.\n\nBitcoin fixes the direct monetization part.[6](#fn:fn-v4v)  \nNostr fixes the interoperability part.\n\nAlright, we got ourselves a boring reading app. Great. Now, imagine that users are able to highlight passages. These highlights, just like bookmarks now, could be private or public. When shared publicly, something interesting emerges: an overlay on existing content, a lens on the written Web. In other words: _swarm highlights_.\n\nImagine a visual overlay of all public highlights, automatically shining a light on what the swarm of readers found most useful, insightful, funny, etc.\n\n![](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/highlights.png)\n\nFurther, imagine the possibility of sharing these highlights as a ”type 1” event with one click, automatically tagging the highlighter(s)—as well as the author, of course—so that eventual sat-flows can be split and forwarded automatically.\n\n![](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/sat-flows.png)\n\nValue-splits could be realized with [Lightning Prisms](https://dergigi.com/prism)\n\nVoilà, you have a system that allows for value to flow back to those who provide it, be it authors, editors, curators, or readers that willingly slog through the information jungle to share and highlight the best stuff (which is a form of curation, of course).\n\nZaps make nostr a defacto address book[7](#fn:fn-pp) of payment information, which is to say lightning addresses, as of now. Thanks to [nostr wallet connect](https://nwc.getalby.com/) (among other developments), sending sats will soon be is already as frictionless as leaving a like.\n\nValue-for-value and participatory payment flows are something that traditional reading apps desperately lack, be it Pocket, Instapaper, Readwise, or the simple reading mode that is part of every browser.\n\nA neat side-effect of a more structured way to share passages of text is that it enables semi-structured discussions around said passages—which could be another useful overlay inside special-purpose clients, providing context and further insights.[8](#fn:5)\n\nFurther, imagine the option of seamlessly switching from text-on-screen to text-to-speech, allowing the user to stream sats if desired, as Podcasting 2.0 clients already do.[9](#fn:3)\n\nImagine user-built curations of the best articles of the week, bundled neatly for your reading pleasure, incentivized by a small value split that allows the curator to participate in the flow of sats.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nI’m sure that the various implementation details will be hashed out, but as I see it, 90% of the stuff is already there. Maybe we’ll need another NIP or two, but I don’t see a reason why this can’t be built—and, more importantly: I don’t see a reason why it wouldn’t be sustainable for everyone involved.\n\nMost puzzle pieces are already there, and the rest of them can probably be implemented by custom event types. From the point of view of nostr, most everything is an event: bookmarks are events, highlights are events, marking something as read is an event, and sharing an excerpt or a highlight is an event. Public actions are out in the open, private actions are encrypted, the data is not in a silo, and everyone wins. Especially the users, those who are at the edge of the network and usually lose out on the value generated.\n\nIn this case, the reading case, the users are mostly “consumers” of content. What changes from the producing perspective, the perspective of the writer?\n\n### Writing\n\nBack to the one thing that nostr got right: information is easy to spread but hard to stifle. In addition to that, digital information can be copied perfectly, which is why it shouldn’t matter where stuff is published in the first place.\n\nAllow me to repeat this point in all caps, for emphasis: **IT SHOULD NOT MATTER WHERE INFORMATION IS PUBLISHED**, and, maybe even more importantly, it shouldn’t matter if it is published in a hundred different places at once.[10](#fn:fn-torrents)\n\nWhat matters is trust and accuracy, which is to say, digital signatures and reputation. To translate this to nostr speak: because every event is signed by default, as long as you trust the person behind the signature, it doesn’t matter from which relay the information is fetched.\n\nThis is already true (or mostly true) on the regular web. Whether you read the internet archive version of an article or the version that is published by an online magazine, the version on the author’s website, or the version read by some guy that has read more about Bitcoin than anyone else you know[11](#fn:fn-guy)—it’s all the same, essentially. What matters is the information itself.\n\nPractically speaking, the source of truth in a hypernostrized world is—you guessed it—an event. An event signed by the author, which allows for the information to be wrapped in a tamper-proof manner, which in turn allows the information to spread far and wide—without it being hosted in one place.\n\nThe first clients that focus on long-form content already exist, and I expect more clients to pop up over time.[12](#fn:4) As mentioned before, one could easily imagine [prism-like value splits](https://dergigi.com/prism) seamlessly integrated into these clients, splitting zaps automatically to compensate writers, editors, proofreaders, and illustrators in a V4V fashion. Further, one could imagine various compute-intensive services built into these special-purpose clients, such as GPT Ghostwriters, or writing aids such as Grammarly and the like. All these services could be seamlessly paid for in sats, without the requirement of any sign-ups or the gathering of any user data. That’s the beauty of [money proper](https://dergigi.com/rediscovery).\n\n![](https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-04-04-purple-text-orange-highlights/nostr-reader-and-writer.png)\n\nPlagiarism is one issue that needs to be dealt with, of course. Humans are greedy, and some humans are assholes. Neither bitcoin nor nostr fixes this. However, while plagiarism detection is not necessarily trivial, it is also not impossible, especially if most texts are published on nostr first.

Read by Guy Swann.Not too long ago, I tried to paint a picture of what a vision for a value-enabled web could look like. Now, only a couple of months later, all this stuff is being built. On nostr, and on lightning. Orange and purple, a match made in heaven.It goes without saying that I’m beyond delighted. What a time to be alive!nostrHere’s the thing that nostr got right, and it’s the same thing that Bitcoin got right: information is easy to spread and hard to stifle.1 Information can be copied quickly and perfectly, which is, I believe, the underlying reason for its desire to be free.Easy to spread, hard to stifle. That’s the base reality of the nature of information. As always, the smart thing is to work with nature, not against it.2 That’s what’s beautiful about the orange coin and the purple ostrich: both manage to work with the peculiarities of information, not against them. Both realize that information can and should be copied, as it can be perfectly read and easily spread, always. Both understand that resistance to censorship comes from writing to many places, making the cost of deletion prohibitive.Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor’s younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.Eric Hughes, A Cypherpunk’s ManifestoNostr is quickly establishing itself as a base layer for information exchange, one that is identity-native and value-enabled. It is distinctly different from systems that came before it, just like Bitcoin is distinctly different from monies that came before it.As of today, the focus of nostr is mostly on short text notes, the so-called “type 1” events more commonly known as tweets.3 However, as you should be aware by now, nostr is way more than just an alternative to twitter. It is a new paradigm. Change the note kind from 1 to 30023 and you don’t have an alternative to Twitter, but a replacement for Medium, Substack, and all the other long-form platforms. I believe that special-purpose clients that focus on certain content types will emerge over time, just like we have seen the emergence of special-purpose platforms in the Web 2.0 era. This time, however, the network effects are cumulative, not separate. A new paradigm.Let me now turn to one such special-purpose client, a nostr-based reading app.ReadingI’m constantly surprised that, even though most people do read a lot online, very few people seem to have a reading workflow or reading tools.Why that is is anyone’s guess, but maybe the added value of such tools is not readily apparent. You can just read the stuff right there, on the ad-ridden, dead-ugly site, right? Why should you sign up for another site, use another app, or bind yourself to another closed platform?That’s a fair point, but the success of Medium and Substack shows that there is an appetite for clean reading and writing, as well as providing avenues for authors to get paid for their writing (and a willingness of readers to support said authors, just because).The problem is, of course, that all of these platforms are platforms, which is to say, walled gardens that imprison readers and writers alike. Worse than that: they are fiat platforms, which means that permissionless value-flows are not only absent from their DNA, they are outright impossible.4Nostr fixes this. The beauty of nostr is that it is not a platform. It’s a protocol, which means that you don’t have to sign up for it—you can create an identity yourself. You don’t have to ask for permission; you just do, without having to rely on the benevolence of whatever dictator is in charge of the platform right now.Nostr is not a platform, and yet, powerful tools and services can be built and monetized on top of it. This is good for users, good for service providers, and good for the network(s) at large. Win-win-win.So what am I talking about, exactly? How can nostr improve everyone’s reading (and writing) experience?Allow me to paint a (rough) picture of what I have in mind. Nostr already supports private and public bookmarks, so let’s start from there.Imagine a special-purpose client that scans all your bookmarks for long-form content.5 Everything that you marked to be read later is shown in an orderly fashion, which is to say searchable, sortable, filterable, and displayed without distractions. Voilà, you have yourself a reading app. That’s, in essence, how Pocket, Readwise, and other reading apps work. But all these apps are walled gardens without much interoperability and without direct monetization.Bitcoin fixes the direct monetization part.6  Nostr fixes the interoperability part.Alright, we got ourselves a boring reading app. Great. Now, imagine that users are able to highlight passages. These highlights, just like bookmarks now, could be private or public. When shared publicly, something interesting emerges: an overlay on existing content, a lens on the written Web. In other words: swarm highlights.Imagine a visual overlay of all public highlights, automatically shining a light on what the swarm of readers found most useful, insightful, funny, etc. Further, imagine the possibility of sharing these highlights as a ”type 1” event with one click, automatically tagging the highlighter(s)—as well as the author, of course—so that eventual sat-flows can be split and forwarded automatically. Value-splits could be realized with Lightning PrismsVoilà, you have a system that allows for value to flow back to those who provide it, be it authors, editors, curators, or readers that willingly slog through the information jungle to share and highlight the best stuff (which is a form of curation, of course).Zaps make nostr a defacto address book7 of payment information, which is to say lightning addresses, as of now. Thanks to nostr wallet connect (among other developments), sending sats will soon be is already as frictionless as leaving a like.Value-for-value and participatory payment flows are something that traditional reading apps desperately lack, be it Pocket, Instapaper, Readwise, or the simple reading mode that is part of every browser.A neat side-effect of a more structured way to share passages of text is that it enables semi-structured discussions around said passages—which could be another useful overlay inside special-purpose clients, providing context and further insights.8Further, imagine the option of seamlessly switching from text-on-screen to text-to-speech, allowing the user to stream sats if desired, as Podcasting 2.0 clients already do.9Imagine user-built curations of the best articles of the week, bundled neatly for your reading pleasure, incentivized by a small value split that allows the curator to participate in the flow of sats.You get the idea.I’m sure that the various implementation details will be hashed out, but as I see it, 90% of the stuff is already there. Maybe we’ll need another NIP or two, but I don’t see a reason why this can’t be built—and, more importantly: I don’t see a reason why it wouldn’t be sustainable for everyone involved.Most puzzle pieces are already there, and the rest of them can probably be implemented by custom event types. From the point of view of nostr, most everything is an event: bookmarks are events, highlights are events, marking something as read is an event, and sharing an excerpt or a highlight is an event. Public actions are out in the open, private actions are encrypted, the data is not in a silo, and everyone wins. Especially the users, those who are at the edge of the network and usually lose out on the value generated.In this case, the reading case, the users are mostly “consumers” of content. What changes from the producing perspective, the perspective of the writer?WritingBack to the one thing that nostr got right: information is easy to spread but hard to stifle. In addition to that, digital information can be copied perfectly, which is why it shouldn’t matter where stuff is published in the first place.Allow me to repeat this point in all caps, for emphasis: IT SHOULD NOT MATTER WHERE INFORMATION IS PUBLISHED, and, maybe even more importantly, it shouldn’t matter if it is published in a hundred different places at once.10What matters is trust and accuracy, which is to say, digital signatures and reputation. To translate this to nostr speak: because every event is signed by default, as long as you trust the person behind the signature, it doesn’t matter from which relay the information is fetched.This is already true (or mostly true) on the regular web. Whether you read the internet archive version of an article or the version that is published by an online magazine, the version on the author’s website, or the version read by some guy that has read more about Bitcoin than anyone else you know11—it’s all the same, essentially. What matters is the information itself.Practically speaking, the source of truth in a hypernostrized world is—you guessed it—an event. An event signed by the author, which allows for the information to be wrapped in a tamper-proof manner, which in turn allows the information to spread far and wide—without it being hosted in one place.The first clients that focus on long-form content already exist, and I expect more clients to pop up over time.12 As mentioned before, one could easily imagine prism-like value splits seamlessly integrated into these clients, splitting zaps automatically to compensate writers, editors, proofreaders, and illustrators in a V4V fashion. Further, one could imagine various compute-intensive services built into these special-purpose clients, such as GPT Ghostwriters, or writing aids such as Grammarly and the like. All these services could be seamlessly paid for in sats, without the requirement of any sign-ups or the gathering of any user data. That’s the beauty of money proper. Plagiarism is one issue that needs to be dealt with, of course. Humans are greedy, and some humans are assholes. Neither bitcoin nor nostr fixes this. However, while plagiarism detection is not necessarily trivial, it is also not impossible, especially if most texts are published on nostr first. Nostr-based publishing tools allow for OpenTimestamp attestations thanks to NIP-03, which in turn allows for plagiarism detection based on “first seen” lookups.That’s just one way to deal with the problem, of course. In any case, I’m confident that we’ll figure it out.ValueI believe that in the open attention information economy we find ourselves in, value will mostly derive from effective curation, dissemination, and transmission of information, not the exclusive ownership of it.Although it is still early days, the statistics around Podcasting 2.0 and nostr zaps clearly show that (a) people are willing to monetarily reward content they care about, and (b) the willingness to send sats increases as friction decreases.The ingenious thing about boostagrams and zaps is that they are direct and visible, which is to say, public and interactive.

You may see “post” and “note” used interchangeably on Nostr. An “event” in Nostr can be any one of these previously mentioned actions. \n\nOne thing to make abundantly clear: Nostr is a _**protocol**_. \n\nIt’s a set of rules that servers and clients use to communicate (just like Bitcoin, email or Bittorrent). Nostr is not an app nor a “platform” (like Twitter, Facebook, etc.), but many applications can be built on top of Nostr. \n\nIn the words of [Edward Snowden](https://snort.social/p/npub1sn0wdenkukak0d9dfczzeacvhkrgz92ak56egt7vdgzn8pv2wfqqhrjdv9), _“If a platform is a silo, a protocol is a river: no one owns it, and everyone is free to swim.”_\n\nUnlike Twitter or Facebook, Nostr is decentralized. There are no central servers or corporations who control what you can post and what others can see. Nostr is censorship-resistant and open source. The license for Nostr is simply “[Public Domain](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr#license).”\n\n_**How does Nostr work?**_\n\nTo use Nostr, you must run a client. A client is simply the way you interact with Nostr (web client in your browser, mobile client on your iPhone, native client, etc.).\n\nTo publish something on Nostr, you write a post (note), sign it with your key and send it to multiple relays. You have two keys: your public key and your private key. Think of the _**public key**_ as your username (like your @handle on Twitter). Think of your _**private key**_ as your password; DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.\n\nTo find another Nostr user, you just need to search in your client of choice using their public key. Here is mine ([@walker](https://snort.social/p/npub1cj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsqwrz4u)): npub1cj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsqwrz4u\n\nOnce you follow someone on Nostr, you can @ them just like on Twitter (e.g. [@walker](https://snort.social/p/npub1cj8znuztfqkvq89pl8hceph0svvvqk0qay6nydgk9uyq7fhpfsgsqwrz4u))\n\nA _**relay**_ is a server hosted by you or by someone else; anyone can run a relay. \n\nTo get updates from other people, you ask multiple relays if they know anything about these other people. All a relay does is accept posts from people and forward them to other people. You don’t need to trust the relays because signatures are verified on the client side (where you are interacting with Nostr). There are free relays and paid relays. \n\nOn Damus, tap your profile icon in the top left corner, then tap Relays. For best performance, you should add any “recommended” relays. \n\nYou can use any of the hundreds of [free relays](http://nostr.watch/relays/find), but if you want to try a paid relay, here's how to set it up:\n\n1.  Go to [http://eden.nostr.land](http://eden.nostr.land/), [http://nostr.milou.lol](http://nostr.milou.lol/), [http://nostr.wine](http://nostr.wine/), or [http://puravida.nostr.land](http://puravida.nostr.land/)\n2.  Enter your pubkey\n3.  Pay in bitcoin (if you don't have a wallet yet, don't worry! There's a section later in this guide that recommends one and shows you how to use bitcoin on Nostr) \n4.  Add the relay to nostr: \n    *   wss://eden.nostr.land \n    *   wss://nostr.milou.lol\n    *   wss://nostr.wine\n    *   wss://puravida.nostr.land\n5.  Enjoy the superior performance of a paid relay\n\nYou can edit your profile on Damus by clicking the “Edit” button on your profile page. Use [nostr.build](https://nostr.build/) to upload photos (you can use this for posting photos or for your profile picture and header images) and [nostrplebs.com](https://nostrplebs.com/) to get an NIP-05 ID.\n\n![](https://d2a49kd54np2tu.cloudfront.net/fit-in/640x480/IMG_7806_65219754db.JPG)\n\nNow that you have your public/private key pair and you’re using one of the various mobile or web Nostr clients, you’re probably wondering _“how do I find people on Nostr?”_\n\nFear not, because [Derek Ross](https://snort.social/p/npub18ams6ewn5aj2n3wt2qawzglx9mr4nzksxhvrdc4gzrecw7n5tvjqctp424) put together a great list of ways to discover new [Nostriches](https://snort.social/p/npub1khd34txqv7s9vdgvfl925r6ytj8j4janalpq08z342ap7dwds3jskny9x4) below:\n\n_**How do I find people on Nostr?**_\n\n**Use pre-built lists of power users and signal boosters:**\n\n*   [https://snort.social/new](https://snort.social/new): This Nostr client comes with a list of Nostr power users to keep your feed always busy and allows you to search for and easily follow all of your Twitter friends.\n*   [https://bitcoinnostr.com](https://bitcoinnostr.com/): This website consists of Nostr Users that are Bitcoiners.

(Beware of spam.)\n*   **Global Channel** - If your client supports channels, you can check out the Global Channel in your client and find people looking to chat and learn about Nostr together.\n\n_**Can I send money on Nostr?**_\n\nAnyone can send money on Nostr using the power of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nYou can send Lightning invoices directly on Nostr by simply generating an invoice and pasting it into a note. On clients like Damus, the invoice text automatically changes into a nice little pay button. \n\nDownload a wallet ([like Wallet of Satoshi](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1438599608)), tap receive, add a custom amount, and paste the URL into Damus.

Then on Damus, tap \"Edit\" on your profile and paste your copied LNURL address into the \"BITCOIN LIGHTNING TIPS\" section, then save.\n\n_**What do I do now?**_\n\nStart using Nostr! Follow Nostr developers like [@fiatjaf](https://twitter.com/fiatjaf) and [@jb55](https://twitter.com/jb55) (on Twitter and on Nostr), and send them some sats to support the incredible work they’re doing. You can also use this list of [people involved in Nostr projects](https://uselessshit.co/resources/nostr/#the-list) to find other developers.\n\n_**Why does Nostr matter?**_\n\nThere’s a reason people like [Jack](https://twitter.com/jack) and [Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden) are such vocal supporters of Bitcoin and Nostr: open protocols are our best shot at a free future.\n\nWith the increasing restriction of speech and control of content on centralized platforms, Nostr provides a refreshing change as a tool for free expression. \n\nWhen you follow someone, you’ll see everything they post.

People are experimenting, helping each other, and working together toward a future that’s not as bleak as Twitter often makes it seem.\n\nIt’s exciting to be an early adopter.

At the start of his demo, he asked audience members how much value they would derive from a computer that could instantly respond to their actions.\n\nYou can ask the same question of generative AI models. If you had a highly responsive generative AI coding tool to brainstorm new ideas, break big ideas into smaller tasks, and suggest new solutions to problems, how much more creative and productive could you be?\n\nThis isn’t a hypothetical question. AI-assisted engineering workflows are quickly emerging with new generative AI coding tools that offer code suggestions and entire functions in response to natural language prompts and existing code. These tools, and what they can help developers accomplish, are changing fast. That makes it important for every developer to understand what’s happening now—and the implications for how software is and will be built.\n\nIn this article, we’ll give a rundown of what generative AI in software development looks like today by exploring:\n\n*   [The unique value generative AI brings to the developer workflow](https://github.blog/2023-04-14-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-way-developers-work/#the-unique-value-generative-ai-brings-to-the-developer-workflow)\n*   [How generative AI coding tools are designed and built](https://github.blog/2023-04-14-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-way-developers-work/#how-are-generative-ai-coding-tools-designed-and-built)\n*   [Why developers should care about large language models](https://github.blog/2023-04-14-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-way-developers-work/#why-should-developers-care-about-transformers-and-llms)\n*   [How developers are using generative AI coding tools](https://github.blog/2023-04-14-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-way-developers-work/#how-developers-are-using-generative-ai-coding-tools)\n\nThe unique value generative AI brings to the developer workflow[](#the-unique-value-generative-ai-brings-to-the-developer-workflow)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI and automation have been a part of the developer workflow for some time now. From machine learning-powered security checks to CI/CD pipelines, developers already use a variety of automation and AI tools, like [CodeQL on GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-17-leveraging-machine-learning-find-security-vulnerabilities/), for example.\n\n**While there’s overlap between all of these categories, here’s what makes generative AI distinct from automation and other AI coding tools:**\n\n**Automation: 🛤**  \n**You know what needs to be done, and you know of a reliable way to get there every time.**\n\n**Rules-based logic:** 🔎  \n**You know the end goal, but there’s more than one way to achieve it.**\n\n**Machine learning: 🧠  \nYou know the end goal, but the amount of ways to achieve it scales exponentially.  \n**\n\n**Generative AI:** 🌐  \n**You have big coding dreams, and want the freedom to bring them to life.**\n\nYou want to make sure that any new code pushed to your repository follows formatting specifications before it’s merged to the main branch. Instead of manually validating the code, you use [a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions](https://resources.github.com/devops/tools/automation/actions/) to trigger an automated workflow on the event of your choosing (like a commit or pull request).\n\nYou know some patterns of SQL injections, but it’s time consuming to manually scan for them in your code. A tool like [Code QL](https://codeql.github.com/) uses a system of rules to sort through your code and find those patterns, so you don’t have to do it by hand.\n\nYou want to stay on top of security vulnerabilities, but the list of SQL injections continues to grow. A coding tool that uses a machine learning (ML) model, like Code QL, is [trained](https://github.blog/2022-02-17-leveraging-machine-learning-find-security-vulnerabilities/) to not only detect known injections, but also patterns similar to those injections in data it hasn’t seen before. This can help you increase recognition of confirmed vulnerabilities and predict new ones.\n\nGenerative AI coding tools leverage ML to generate novel answers and predict coding sequences. A tool like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) can reduce the amount of times you switch out of your IDE to look up boilerplate code or help you brainstorm coding solutions. Shifting your role from rote writing to strategic decision making, generative AI can help you reflect on your code at a higher, more abstract level—so you can focus more on _what_ you want to build and spend less time worrying about _how_.\n\nBuilding a generative AI coding tool requires training AI models on large amounts of code across programming languages via deep learning. (Deep learning is a way to train computers to process data like we do—by recognizing patterns, making connections, and drawing inferences with limited guidance.)\n\nTo emulate the way humans learn patterns, these AI models use vast networks of nodes, which process and weigh input data, and are designed to function like neurons. Once trained on large amounts of data and able to produce useful code, they’re built into tools and applications. The models can then be plugged into coding editors and IDEs where they respond to natural language prompts or code to suggest new code, functions, and phrases.\n\nBefore we talk about how generative AI coding tools are made, let’s define what they are first. It starts with LLMs, or large language models, which are sets of algorithms trained on large amounts of code and human language. Like we mentioned above, they can predict coding sequences _and_ generate novel content using existing code or natural language prompts.\n\nToday’s state-of-the-art LLMs are transformers. That means they use something called an attention mechanism to make flexible connections between different tokens in a user’s input and the output that the model has already generated. This allows them to provide responses that are more contextually relevant than previous AI models because they’re good at connecting the dots and big-picture thinking.\n\nHere’s an example of how a transformer works. Let’s say you encounter the word log in your code. The transformer node at that place would use the attention mechanism to contextually predict what kind of log would come next in the sequence.\n\nLet’s say, in the example below, you input the statement `from math import log`. A generative AI model would then infer you mean a logarithmic function.\n\n![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/from-math.gif)\n\nAnd if you add the prompt `from logging import log`, it would infer that you’re using a logging function.\n\n![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/from-log.gif)\n\nThough sometimes a log is just a log.\n\n![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/just-a-log.gif)\n\nLLMs can be built using frameworks besides transformers. But LLMs using frameworks, like a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory, struggle with processing long sentences and paragraphs. They also typically require training on labeled data (making training a labor-intensive process). This limits the complexity and relevance of their outputs, and the data they can learn from.\n\nTransformer LLMs, on the other hand, can train themselves on unlabeled data. Once they’re given basic learning objectives, LLMs take a part of the new input data and use it to practice their learning goals. Once they’ve achieved these goals on that portion of the input, they apply what they’ve learned to understand the rest of the input. This self-supervised learning process is what allows transformer LLMs to analyze massive amounts of unlabeled data—and the larger the dataset an LLM is trained on, the more they scale by processing that data.\n\nWhy should developers care about transformers and LLMs?[](#why-should-developers-care-about-transformers-and-llms)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3, GPT-4, and Codex models are trained on an enormous amount of natural language data and publicly available source code. This is part of the reason why tools like ChatGPT and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/), which are built on these models, can produce contextually accurate outputs.\n\nHere’s how GitHub Copilot produces coding suggestions:\n\n*   All of the code you’ve written so far, or the code that comes before the cursor in an IDE, is fed to a series of algorithms that decide what parts of the code will be processed by GitHub Copilot.\n*   Since it’s powered by a transformer-based LLM, GitHub Copilot will apply the patterns it’s abstracted from training data and apply those patterns to your input code.\n*   The result: contextually relevant, original coding suggestions. [GitHub Copilot will even filter out](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/) known security vulnerabilities, vulnerable code patterns, and code that matches other projects.\n\n**Keep in mind:** creating new content such as text, code, and images is at the heart of generative AI. LLMs are adept at abstracting patterns from their training data, applying those patterns to existing language, and then producing language or a line of code that follows those patterns. Given the sheer scale of LLMs, they might generate a language or code sequence that doesn’t even exist yet. Just as you would review a colleague’s code, you should assess and validate AI-generated code, too.\n\n### Why context matters for AI coding tools[](#why-context-matters-for-ai-coding-tools)\n\n[Developing good prompt crafting techniques](https://dev.to/github/a-beginners-guide-to-prompt-engineering-with-github-copilot-3ibp) is important because input code passes through something called a context window, which is present in all transformer-based LLMs. The context window represents the capacity of data an LLM can process. Though it can’t process an infinite amount of data, it can grow larger. Right now, the Codex model has a context window that allows it to process a couple of hundred lines of code, which has already advanced and accelerated coding tasks like code completion and code change summarization.\n\nDevelopers use details from pull requests, a folder in a project, open issues—and the list goes on—to contextualize their code. So, when it comes to a coding tool with a limited context window, the challenge is to figure out what data, in addition to code, will lead to the best suggestions.\n\nThe order of the data also impacts a model’s contextual understanding. Recently, GitHub made updates to its pair programmer so that it considers not only the code immediately before the cursor, but also some of the code after the cursor. The paradigm—which is called [Fill-In-the-Middle](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/) (FIM)—leaves a gap in the middle of the code for GitHub Copilot to fill, providing the tool with more context about the developer’s intended code and how it should align with the rest of the program. This helps produce higher quality code suggestions without any added latency.\n\nVisuals can also contextualize code. Multimodal LLMs (MMLLMs) scale transformer LLMs so they process images and videos, as well as text. OpenAI recently released its new [GPT-4 model](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4)—and Microsoft revealed its own MMLLM called [Kosmos-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14045).

At the start of his demo, he asked audience members how much value they would derive from a computer that could instantly respond to their actions.\nYou can ask the same question of generative AI models. If you had a highly responsive generative AI coding tool to brainstorm new ideas, break big ideas into smaller tasks, and suggest new solutions to problems, how much more creative and productive could you be?\nThis isn’t a hypothetical question. AI-assisted engineering workflows are quickly emerging with new generative AI coding tools that offer code suggestions and entire functions in response to natural language prompts and existing code. These tools, and what they can help developers accomplish, are changing fast. That makes it important for every developer to understand what’s happening now—and the implications for how software is and will be built.\nIn this article, we’ll give a rundown of what generative AI in software development looks like today by exploring:\n\nThe unique value generative AI brings to the developer workflow\nHow generative AI coding tools are designed and built\nWhy developers should care about large language models\nHow developers are using generative AI coding tools\n\nThe unique value generative AI brings to the developer workflow\nAI and automation have been a part of the developer workflow for some time now. From machine learning-powered security checks to CI/CD pipelines, developers already use a variety of automation and AI tools, like CodeQL on GitHub, for example.\nWhile there’s overlap between all of these categories, here’s what makes generative AI distinct from automation and other AI coding tools:\n\n\n\nAutomation: 🛤\nYou know what needs to be done, and you know of a reliable way to get there every time.\nRules-based logic: 🔎\nYou know the end goal, but there’s more than one way to achieve it.\nMachine learning: 🧠\nYou know the end goal, but the amount of ways to achieve it scales exponentially.\n\nGenerative AI: 🌐\nYou have big coding dreams, and want the freedom to bring them to life.\n\n\nYou want to make sure that any new code pushed to your repository follows formatting specifications before it’s merged to the main branch. Instead of manually validating the code, you use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions to trigger an automated workflow on the event of your choosing (like a commit or pull request).\nYou know some patterns of SQL injections, but it’s time consuming to manually scan for them in your code. A tool like Code QL uses a system of rules to sort through your code and find those patterns, so you don’t have to do it by hand.\nYou want to stay on top of security vulnerabilities, but the list of SQL injections continues to grow. A coding tool that uses a machine learning (ML) model, like Code QL, is trained to not only detect known injections, but also patterns similar to those injections in data it hasn’t seen before. This can help you increase recognition of confirmed vulnerabilities and predict new ones.\nGenerative AI coding tools leverage ML to generate novel answers and predict coding sequences. A tool like GitHub Copilot can reduce the amount of times you switch out of your IDE to look up boilerplate code or help you brainstorm coding solutions. Shifting your role from rote writing to strategic decision making, generative AI can help you reflect on your code at a higher, more abstract level—so you can focus more on what you want to build and spend less time worrying about how.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a generative AI coding tool requires training AI models on large amounts of code across programming languages via deep learning. (Deep learning is a way to train computers to process data like we do—by recognizing patterns, making connections, and drawing inferences with limited guidance.)\nTo emulate the way humans learn patterns, these AI models use vast networks of nodes, which process and weigh input data, and are designed to function like neurons. Once trained on large amounts of data and able to produce useful code, they’re built into tools and applications. The models can then be plugged into coding editors and IDEs where they respond to natural language prompts or code to suggest new code, functions, and phrases.\n\nBefore we talk about how generative AI coding tools are made, let’s define what they are first. It starts with LLMs, or large language models, which are sets of algorithms trained on large amounts of code and human language. Like we mentioned above, they can predict coding sequences and generate novel content using existing code or natural language prompts.\nToday’s state-of-the-art LLMs are transformers. That means they use something called an attention mechanism to make flexible connections between different tokens in a user’s input and the output that the model has already generated. This allows them to provide responses that are more contextually relevant than previous AI models because they’re good at connecting the dots and big-picture thinking.\nHere’s an example of how a transformer works. Let’s say you encounter the word log in your code. The transformer node at that place would use the attention mechanism to contextually predict what kind of log would come next in the sequence.\nLet’s say, in the example below, you input the statement from math import log. A generative AI model would then infer you mean a logarithmic function.\n\nAnd if you add the prompt from logging import log, it would infer that you’re using a logging function.\n\nThough sometimes a log is just a log.\n\nLLMs can be built using frameworks besides transformers. But LLMs using frameworks, like a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory, struggle with processing long sentences and paragraphs. They also typically require training on labeled data (making training a labor-intensive process). This limits the complexity and relevance of their outputs, and the data they can learn from.\nTransformer LLMs, on the other hand, can train themselves on unlabeled data. Once they’re given basic learning objectives, LLMs take a part of the new input data and use it to practice their learning goals. Once they’ve achieved these goals on that portion of the input, they apply what they’ve learned to understand the rest of the input. This self-supervised learning process is what allows transformer LLMs to analyze massive amounts of unlabeled data—and the larger the dataset an LLM is trained on, the more they scale by processing that data.\nWhy should developers care about transformers and LLMs?\nLLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3, GPT-4, and Codex models are trained on an enormous amount of natural language data and publicly available source code. This is part of the reason why tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, which are built on these models, can produce contextually accurate outputs.\nHere’s how GitHub Copilot produces coding suggestions:\n\nAll of the code you’ve written so far, or the code that comes before the cursor in an IDE, is fed to a series of algorithms that decide what parts of the code will be processed by GitHub Copilot.\nSince it’s powered by a transformer-based LLM, GitHub Copilot will apply the patterns it’s abstracted from training data and apply those patterns to your input code.\nThe result: contextually relevant, original coding suggestions. GitHub Copilot will even filter out known security vulnerabilities, vulnerable code patterns, and code that matches other projects.\n\nKeep in mind: creating new content such as text, code, and images is at the heart of generative AI. LLMs are adept at abstracting patterns from their training data, applying those patterns to existing language, and then producing language or a line of code that follows those patterns. Given the sheer scale of LLMs, they might generate a language or code sequence that doesn’t even exist yet. Just as you would review a colleague’s code, you should assess and validate AI-generated code, too.\nWhy context matters for AI coding tools\nDeveloping good prompt crafting techniques is important because input code passes through something called a context window, which is present in all transformer-based LLMs. The context window represents the capacity of data an LLM can process. Though it can’t process an infinite amount of data, it can grow larger. Right now, the Codex model has a context window that allows it to process a couple of hundred lines of code, which has already advanced and accelerated coding tasks like code completion and code change summarization.\nDevelopers use details from pull requests, a folder in a project, open issues—and the list goes on—to contextualize their code. So, when it comes to a coding tool with a limited context window, the challenge is to figure out what data, in addition to code, will lead to the best suggestions.\nThe order of the data also impacts a model’s contextual understanding. Recently, GitHub made updates to its pair programmer so that it considers not only the code immediately before the cursor, but also some of the code after the cursor. The paradigm—which is called Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM)—leaves a gap in the middle of the code for GitHub Copilot to fill, providing the tool with more context about the developer’s intended code and how it should align with the rest of the program. This helps produce higher quality code suggestions without any added latency.\nVisuals can also contextualize code. Multimodal LLMs (MMLLMs) scale transformer LLMs so they process images and videos, as well as text. OpenAI recently released its new GPT-4 model—and Microsoft revealed its own MMLLM called Kosmos-1. These models are designed to respond to natural language and images, like alternating text and images, image-caption pairs, and text data.\nGitHub’s senior developer advocate Christina Warren shares the latest on GPT-4 and the creative potential it holds for developers:\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nThe field of generative AI is filled with experiments and explorations to uncover the technology’s full capabilities—and how they can enable effective developer workflows. Generative AI tools are already changing how developers write code and build software, from improving productivity to helping developers focus on bigger problems.\nWhile generative AI applications in software development are still being actively defined, today, developers are using generative AI coding tools to:\n\nGet a head start on complex code translation tasks. A study presented at the 2021 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces found that generative AI provided developers with a skeletal framework to translate legacy source code into Python.

In 2017, Apple [removed several VPN](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/31/apple-removes-vpn-apps-in-china-app-store.html) apps from the China App Store, since VPNs could allow oppressed Chinese citizens to access websites that are banned in mainland China. In 2020, they purged 46,000 apps from the China App Store in [_one day_](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/31/apple-purges-44000-apps-from-china-app-store-over-lack-of-licenses).\n\nA few weeks after the Damus removal, [snort.social](https://snort.social/) was blocked by the [Great Firewall of China](http://www.chinafirewalltest.com/).\n\nLink: [https://snort.social/e/note14kqd4yggvfpj9muu5np7z3r5a3gs4g3txqc62dpsuttsz830k3usqu9v4n](https://snort.social/e/note14kqd4yggvfpj9muu5np7z3r5a3gs4g3txqc62dpsuttsz830k3usqu9v4n) \n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HXebqk1bacp42MzWMMxr9i5-aPdklpMMKHIqaNgeBLT4_A55vcnjAC8DCaiugmRqiabey3aA04xCDR5ARUqdb1Iigdz-o6Ak-k7HVmNiBC9Mn6pbEzR6hQUdueCclSYxcBjUUyFqJj14Zb30ttIofno)\n\nIt is likely that China will continue to block Nostr clients like Damus and Snort, because they simply cannot allow free speech, nor the free propagation of information, to exist. Such is the nature of Communism.\n\nUnfortunately for the free speech-fearing totalitarians at the CCP, **Nostr is a** [**hydra**](https://mythologysource.com/hydra-serpent-greek-myth/): every time you cut off a head, two more will grow in its place. \n\nChina banning Damus shows exactly why open protocols like Nostr are useful and necessary to avoid state overreach: there is no throat to choke. No single head to decapitate. \n\nCut off one, two grow in its place. Ban one Nostr client and freedom-loving cypherpunks across the world will create two more. You can slow it down, but not stop it, and any attempts to do so only draw more attention to it (we should almost thank the CCP for the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)).\n\n**Nostr finds a way.** \n-----------------------\n\nA couple weeks ago, [Will](https://snort.social/p/npub1xtscya34g58tk0z605fvr788k263gsu6cy9x0mhnm87echrgufzsevkk5s) posted [“You can't stop us CCP](https://damus.io/note183cfm99hh0mhsgj6qwqt3sx3rkzp3xrsy8rt76re8s5jfwpae46qm7ut33)”, and shared the following encrypted DM he received on Nostr: _“There’s always a way.

The State can remove apps and ban websites, but more will spring up in their place. Chinese citizens who want to speak freely and be heard may have to work a little harder, but at least Nostr gives them a fighting chance.\n\nIf you stumbled upon this article and have yet to try Nostr for yourself, check out my prior guide ([What is Nostr? How Does it Work?

Hughes was adamant that _“the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all”_ and that _“privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems.”_\n\nWith Nostr and Bitcoin, we see the realization of Hughes’ manifesto: an open source, privacy-protecting protocol for free speech combined with an open source protocol for money, both enabled by cryptography.\n\nWe need not be completely anonymous, I am certainly not. What is important is that each of us has the _choice_ to reveal ourselves as we see fit, protected by the power of an open-source, cryptographic hydra: \n\n_**“Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”**_ \n\nNostr was created by a pseudonymous cypherpunk who goes by “[fiatjaf](https://iris.to/fiatjaf.com).” Today, take a moment to thank an open source developer. If you find what they do valuable, consider zapping them some sats on Nostr. After all, no one can stop you.\n\nI’ll leave you with one final quote from Hughes:\n\n> Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write.

TechnologyBusinessBitcoinMar 10, 2023 at 2:23 UTC780089Damus, Nostr’s first iOS client, went live on the App Store on January 31st, 2023. Within two days, Apple had already bent the knee to the Chinese Communist Party and removed it from the App Store in China.Will Casarin, the creator of Damus, received the following notice from Apple: We are writing to notify you that your application, per demand from the CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China), will be removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal in China.Presumably the Damus functionality that is “illegal in China” is the ability to speak freely and be heard.The Totalitarian TemptationBanning apps is nothing new for Apple. In 2017, Apple removed several VPN apps from the China App Store, since VPNs could allow oppressed Chinese citizens to access websites that are banned in mainland China. In 2020, they purged 46,000 apps from the China App Store in one day.A few weeks after the Damus removal, snort.social was blocked by the Great Firewall of China.Link: https://snort.social/e/note14kqd4yggvfpj9muu5np7z3r5a3gs4g3txqc62dpsuttsz830k3usqu9v4n It is likely that China will continue to block Nostr clients like Damus and Snort, because they simply cannot allow free speech, nor the free propagation of information, to exist. Such is the nature of Communism.Unfortunately for the free speech-fearing totalitarians at the CCP, Nostr is a hydra: every time you cut off a head, two more will grow in its place. China banning Damus shows exactly why open protocols like Nostr are useful and necessary to avoid state overreach: there is no throat to choke. No single head to decapitate. Cut off one, two grow in its place. Ban one Nostr client and freedom-loving cypherpunks across the world will create two more. You can slow it down, but not stop it, and any attempts to do so only draw more attention to it (we should almost thank the CCP for the Streisand effect).Nostr finds a way. A couple weeks ago, Will posted “You can't stop us CCP”, and shared the following encrypted DM he received on Nostr: “There’s always a way. I’m sending this through to you from downtown Shanghai.”Information wants to be free, to flow like water. Open protocols like Nostr and Bitcoin are resilient and adaptable in the face of censorship or attempted State control because they facilitate the free flow of information, the free flow of value.Open protocols are like water.Just look at China’s Bitcoin mining ban; it may make mining more difficult, but it certainly hasn’t stopped it.The same will be true of Nostr usage in China and in other authoritarian regions around the world. The State can remove apps and ban websites, but more will spring up in their place. Chinese citizens who want to speak freely and be heard may have to work a little harder, but at least Nostr gives them a fighting chance.If you stumbled upon this article and have yet to try Nostr for yourself, check out my prior guide (What is Nostr?

Avoiding the caveat of too many large (centralized) relays, many of unknown architecture and availability.

Change any other settings you feel confident you need to alter.\n\nStart your container with `docker-compose` to test working from directory with the _docker-compose.yml_ file: `sudo docker-compose up`\n\nThis will start container in terminal. Once you are happy configuration is working can start as a daemon: `sudo docker-compose up -d`\n\nAdd Nginx Reverse Proxy and SSL\n-------------------------------\n\nInstall nginx on your relay: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx`\n\nRemove default config: `sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`\n\nCreate new default config: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default` Add new reverse proxy config:\n\n        server{\n            server_name relay.yourdomain.com;\n            location / {\n                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n                proxy_set_header Host $host;\n                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7777;\n                proxy_http_version 1.1;\n                proxy_read_timeout 300s;\n                proxy_connect_timeout 300s;\n                proxy_send_timeout 300s;\n                send_timeout 300s;\n                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n                proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n            }\n        }\n    \n\nChange `relay.yourdomain.com` to your DNS name.\n\nRestart nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`\n\n### Add LetsEncrypt SSL Certificate\n\nUse `certbot` to create new SSL and install it with nginx-plugin (replace with your DNS name): `sudo certbot --nginx -d relay.yourdomain.com`\n\nRestart nginx again: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`\n\nIf no errors then good to go!\n\nTesting and Usage\n-----------------\n\nYou can now install something like [nostril](https://github.com/jb55/nostril) to test your relay. Just use a testing nostr account you add to whitelist.js to test with. Or add relay to your client.\n\n    nostril --envelope --sec <your sec hex key> --content \"docker container is working and whitelisting!\" | websocat ws://localhost:7777\n    \n    \n\nUsing Other strfry Commands\n---------------------------\n\nSee container name or ID: `sudo docker ps`\n\nEnter container to get bash access: `sudo docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`\n\nThis will show you have entered the running container. You can now run any strfry commands needed.

It is not too difficult to run your own private relay at home or on an inexpensive cloud provider.\n\nDigital Ocean $200 Credit\n\nThe following is based on the unofficial strfry docker repo:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/cryptocartel/strfry\n\nInstall Requirements\n\n(In this example we're assuming your host is running Ubuntu 22.04 but should work with most Debian based OSs)\n\nOn your cloud server or home server be sure to install Docker.\n\nNow install docker-compose:\n\ncurl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n\nMake executable:\n\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n\nPoint DNS to IP of Relay\n\nIn your DNS registrar or hosting control panel add an A record for relay.yourdomain.com\nto your instance public IP. You can alternatively use dynamic DNS if hosting from home. If using from home I recommend using a free CloudFlare account to proxy DNS to your home IP to obfuscate it. There are many videos and howtos on this.\n\nCreate docker-compose.yml\n\nMake a docker-compose.yml file with contents below:\n\nservices:\n  strfry-nostr-relay:\n    image: cryptocartel/strfry:latest\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    volumes:\n      - /local/path/to/strfry-data/etc:/etc/\n      - /local/path/to/strfry-data/strfry-db:/app/strfry-db\n      - /local/path/to/strfry-data/plugins:/app/plugins\n    ports:\n      - \"7777:7777\"\n\n\nAdd whitelist.js Plugin to Lock Down Relay\n\nAdd the following to you plugins directory:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nconst whiteList = {\n    '003ba9b2c5bd8afeed41a4ce362a8b7fc3ab59c25b6a1359cae9093f296dac01': true,\n};\n\nconst rl = require('readline').createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout,\n  terminal: false\n});\n\nrl.on('line', (line) => {\n    let req = JSON.parse(line);\n\n    if (req.type === 'lookback') { \n        return; // do nothing\n    } \n\n    if (req.type !== 'new') {\n        console.error(\"unexpected request type\"); // will appear in strfry logs\n        return;\n    }\n\n    let res = { id: req.event.id }; // must echo the event's id\n\n    if (whiteList[req.event.pubkey]) {\n        res.action = 'accept';\n    } else {\n        res.action = 'reject';\n        res.msg = 'blocked: not on white-list';\n    }\n\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(res));\n});\n\n\nChange the hex public key (003ba9b2c5bd8afeed41a4ce362a8b7fc3ab59c25b6a1359cae9093f296dac01) to yours and add others you want to allow to use the relay.\n\nMake it executable:\n\nsudo chmod +x whitelist.js\n\n\nCreate your strfry.conf in your /etc directory from above docker-compose.yml\n\n##\n## Default strfry config for cryptocartel/strfry Docker\n##\n\n# Directory that contains the strfry LMDB database (restart required)\ndb = \"./strfry-db/\"\n\ndbParams {\n    # Maximum number of threads/processes that can simultaneously have LMDB transactions open (restart required)\n    maxreaders = 256\n\n    # Size of mmap() to use when loading LMDB (default is 10TB, does *not* correspond to disk-space used) (restart required)\n    mapsize = 10995116277760\n}\n\nrelay {\n    # Interface to listen on.

Just use a testing nostr account you add to whitelist.js to test with. Or add relay to your client.\n\nnostril --envelope --sec <your sec hex key> --content \"docker container is working and whitelisting!\" | websocat ws://localhost:7777\n\n\n\nUsing Other strfry Commands\n\nSee container name or ID:\nsudo docker ps\n\nEnter container to get bash access:\nsudo docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash\n\nThis will show you have entered the running container.

A centralized server tends to be very efficient and self-reinforcing, and so centralized solutions get deployed, get the initial users, and thus entrench themselves for decades.\nOne of the ways to decentralize the internet is to normalize running a home server and make it easier to do so. As technology improves, basic server-grade computers have become more accessible, and a number of hardware and software solutions have come into existence that are geared towards a consumer server market. However, there are still long-term limitations on peoples’ interest or financial ability to run a server. The financial and bandwidth constraints are particularly problematic for potential users in developing countries.\nOn the other hand, some technologies enable more peer-to-peer information transfer. File-sharing, video calls, and things like that can allow people to connect to each other in high-bandwidth ways. Keet, for example, is far faster and higher resolution than Zoom for video chats involving modest amounts of people. A challenge with pure peer-to-peer models is that both users have to be online at the same time to coordinate.\nA middle-ground method that seems to be beginning to work at scale is the idea of distributed servers or “relays”. In this model, not every user has to run a server, but individual servers are relatively easy to run, are financially incentivized to be run, and are therefore numerous enough that there is no way to control or censor the network. The result is a rather decentralized web of servers that connect to each other, and users that connect to them.\nA good example of this is Nostr. It’s an open-source protocol that stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays”. For the first two years of its existence it was relatively unused, but in 2022 it started to get more traction.

Banks and brokerages operate permissioned ledgers. Opening accounts with institutions is a permissioned activity. Sending assets between institutions is a permissioned activity domestically, and especially globally. The base currency itself has a central issuer.\n\nThe internet had many open aspects early on, and still does, but it largely consolidated into silos over time. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, and platforms like these are closed networks. Opening accounts with them is a permissioned activity, how you use them is a permissioned activity, and sending information between these platforms has generally not been possible. How exactly do their algorithms work? Since most of them are closed, we can’t know.\n\nToday, open monetary protocols (e.g. Bitcoin), as well as the emergence of newer open information protocols (e.g. Nostr), challenge this state of affairs and/or present alternative parallel systems for which people globally can use, explore, and build on. This article examines some of the prospects and potential implications of their adoption.\n\nClosed-Source Money\n-------------------\n\nBank accounts give users access to the traditional globally-connected banking system. A global network of interconnected banks allow for domestic and global money exchange, with varying amounts of settlement time for those transactions.\n\nIn recent decades, various fintech companies have developed as layers on top of traditional banking rails, to modernize and quicken the process of sending money. Contrary to popular perception, these types of companies aren’t going around banks or competing with banks; they are layers on top of the existing banking apparatus that still make use of various banks with central bank connections, but in a way that abstracts the experience for the user.\n\nWith credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, and others- an increasing number of methods to move around small or medium amounts of money have greatly decreased digital payment times from the user perspective. Behind the scenes, however, there is still a complex and slow backend financial handshaking process that occurs along the way, as various intermediate financial institutions take on temporary credit.\n\nIn other words, when a small fintech payment seems instantly finished from the user perspective, the banks in the background are still spending hours or days finalizing it behind the curtain in larger batches, and thus holding IOUs to each other in the process.\n\nReliably sending global payments is much more burdensome, slow, and expensive. Wire transfers often get caught up and delayed in opaque ways. Many fintech services are only available in one economic bloc, such as the United States, and have no ability to send foreign payments. To the extent that a bank or service allows for global payments, it can feel like a stressful event each time, as you wonder if it will go through or get blocked for some arcane reason and need to be re-attempted, thus wasting time.\n\nMy local credit union used to offer international wire transfers (by piggy-backing on Bank of America for the infrastructure, and for quite a hefty fee) but now no longer does. I have to use my Big Bank account now, when sending global wires.\n\nThere’s an unfortunate problem for global payments: small transactions tend to have the highest percent fees, and their payees and recipients can least afford it. Many people in developing countries travel internationally for work and send money home to their families in small amounts, with intermediaries collecting high fees and not innovating quickly (or at all) to reduce them, and with little incentive to do so. [According to the World Bank](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/), the average fee percentage on a remittance payment is 6.3%. When sending remittance payments directly with banks, the fee percentage is 11.7%. Fintech companies and mobile payment solutions are responsible for lowering the average, but the average is still very high.\n\nGlobally, only about [76% of people have an account](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex) at a bank or at a fintech platform that connects to a bank. In many countries and regions, the numbers remain very low. In Nigeria, for example, only 45% of people have an account. In Palestine, only 34% do. Having a physical bank branch is expensive, and providing manual customer service comes with substantial overhead costs. If someone has a few hundred dollars, it is usually not worth the bank’s time to give them an account.\n\n[According to the World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/where-world-do-women-still-face-legal-barriers-own-and-administer-assets), 75 countries also still have restrictions on women’s rights to manage assets. So, in addition to technical or monopoly-like problems with sending or holding money, there are some social bottlenecks as well.\n\nFurthermore, many people aren’t aware of the problematic combination of refugees and banking. Banking is a centralized and permissioned activity, governed by a nation’s central bank, with tight regulation. This almost always involves mandating that the banks collect identification on customers. However, many refugees from impoverished or war-torn regions don’t have IDs, and don’t have a clear or convenient path towards getting one, depending on the jurisdiction they’ve fled to. The problem is further compounded if they don’t have enough money or income for a bank to care.\n\nMeanwhile, over 86% of people ([over 7.1 billion people](https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/Mobile_Statistics_Report,_2021-2025_Executive_Summary.pdf)) have a smartphone globally, and the percentage is rising quickly. The proliferation and exponential nature of technology has allowed smart phone usage to leapfrog banking access in many areas. Phone and mobile internet adoption is expected to continue to spread into poorer and poorer areas over the next five and ten years.\n\nPeople who work in what society considers to be undesirable industries often have trouble getting banked, or tend to get de-banked (including by fintech companies) after already being banked. Even the mere process of spreading information can lead to de-banking, such as the well-known case of Wikileaks losing its fintech payment platform access in 2010. If a protest is considered unacceptable, whether it’s in Nigeria or Canada or wherever else, protestors may have their bank accounts frozen, donations to protestors may be frozen or reversed, and even those making donations may find their financial access frozen.\n\nAnd we must consider this from a global perspective: [billions of people live in authoritarian countries](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule) and the number is no longer improving:\n\n![Democratization](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/open-networks-democratization.png)\n\nChart Source: [Freedom House 2023 Report](https://freedomhouse.org/)\n\nOpen-Source Money\n-----------------\n\nFor decades since at least the early 1980s, cryptographers and cypherpunks researched ways to build internet-native monies that go around the banking system. Many early implementations were centralized, and thus either failed to accrue a network effect and stagnated into bankruptcy, or were actively shut down by the government.\n\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto built on prior work and launched what has thus far been the most successful open-source monetary network: Bitcoin. For 14 years and counting, it has provided an open (yet still rather niche) payments and savings network to anyone with an internet connection, and in a way that has thus far been able to maintain decentralization and resistance to censorship. A subset of analysts around the world continue to examine it to determine 1) whether it will continue to exist and remain functional and 2) what implications it may have if it does.\n\n[![Bitcoin Market Capitalization](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/open-network-bitcoin-market-cap.png)](https://ycharts.com/store/start_trial_register?utm_source=lyn+alden)\n\nNobody can reverse or censor transactions by decree; the only way to do so is to gain 51% of the network’s processing power and override the rest of the network. And since it’s an open-source network with nobody in charge, anyone with the physical capability to do so can interact with it in various ways:\n\n\\-A user can run a free open-source node client and participate in running the network, sending permissionless payments, and auditing details of the protocol.\n\n\\-Without even using software, a user can generate a private key by flipping a coin 256 times and use it to receive bitcoin as payments.\n\n\\-A user can memorize twelve words, travel across the world, and be able to reconstruct their ability to access their bitcoin at a later date.\n\n\\-A programmer can make a non-custodial wallet application that interfaces with the network and makes interacting with it easier for a non-technical user.\n\n\\-A financial services company can operate as a custodian, or as a collaborative custody provider that holds a 1-of-3 backup key in a multi-signature arrangement while the user holds 2-of-3 keys.\n\nWhen we look at a closed monetary network such as the Federal Reserve system, it is strictly hierarchical. The underlying settlement networks, such as Fedwire, are only accessible to banks. To the extent that a user wants to make use of it, they can only do so indirectly, by being a customer at a bank or a fintech company that connects to a bank. To the extent that a fintech developer or a new bank figures out a way to make access to the network better, they can only do so with permission, by being granted access to a bank and following all regulations which vary by jurisdiction. The [recent denial of Custodia Bank’s application](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/orders20230127a.htm) is a recent example to show how permissioned and hierarchical the system is.\n\n![Closed Monetary Protocol Layers](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/closed-monetary-protocol-direct-layers.png)\n\nAn open monetary network works differently. Users can directly access the network if they want to. Or they can go through larger platforms that make various trade-offs for the sake of convenience. Furthermore, people can directly interact with whatever part of the stack that suits their specific needs at a specific time, such as the base layer or software layers on top of it (e.g. Lightning). Any developer can create a new way to interface with it, or a new layer on top of it, and offer it into the global marketplace without waiting for an application to a centralized authority to be approved.\n\n![Direct Layer User Choice](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/open-monetary-protocol-direct-layers.png)\n\nClosed-Source Social Media\n--------------------------\n\nOn its surface, the internet seems reasonably decentralized. A consistent protocol stack built around Internet Protocol is used around the world, and on top of that protocol stack there are various websites or other types of servers, and there are multiple different methods to access them (e.g. different operating systems, browser applications, and so forth).\n\nThe ways that people tend to use it, however, have become quite controllable and siloed. The rise of major social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others consolidated many users into big pools of connectivity. Rather than everyone making their own websites, most users create accounts on big platforms, and thus subject themselves to the various rules and algorithms of that platform in exchange for the convenience and access that those platforms provide. Billions of people congregate around these pools of activity, which are offered for free in exchange for harvesting all of their data. Small and separately-run internet forum websites used to be popular, but these have tended to consolidate towards subsections of major social media platforms. To the extent that people search for new websites, it’s dominated by Google’s search algorithm.\n\nA Twitter user can’t send a direct message to a Facebook user. A LinkedIn user can’t bring their followers with them if they create a Twitter account. They all tend to be siloed.\n\n![Closed Information Protocol](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/closed-information-protocol.png)\n\nThose platforms then use various private algorithms to determine what information gets shown to users, and have discretion around content moderation policies to remove posts or entire accounts as they deem fit, or as required to by their government.\n\nWe can imagine this from a corporate, government, and user perspective, and see what each one is trying to maximize for.\n\nFrom a corporation’s perspective, they need to be able to remove illegal activity or outright spam, so that they can comply with laws and so that their platform doesn’t turn into a tragedy of the commons. They also need to tune their algorithm in such a way that it gives people the connections that make sense to them, and keep them on the platform rather than going elsewhere.\n\nFrom a government’s perspective, people act very differently online than offline. They are more impersonal, more aggressive, and easier to manipulate with fake data (including via foreign agents) when online. Algorithms, if improperly tuned, can feed a billion people more of what makes them emotional from people who are already in their digital tribe, and thus close them off from each other and repeatedly exaggerate public outrage in recurring waves.\n\nFrom a user’s perspective, government and corporate power over moderation is prone to corruption. A government can demand a takedown of information that is inconvenient to them or that doesn’t fit their preferred narrative. Corporations can exacerbate outrage and user emotions if it translates into more dollars at the end of the day. Much like the military-industrial complex that has been around for decades, there is a political-finance-media complex as well.\n\nIndia, as a very large but relatively mild example, has established a track record of telling Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms to [remove](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/05/twitter-sues-india-government/) [information](https://theintercept.com/2023/01/24/twitter-elon-musk-modi-india-bbc/) that is unfavorable towards their current administration, and those platforms comply. In many countries that are more restrictive, social media platforms are completely controlled or banned, leaving their population in the dark and disconnected from the rest of the world.\n\nEven private messages can be read by those in power. Some platforms use unencrypted direct messages. Other platforms claim to use encrypted direct messages, but there is no way for a user to prove that they really are encrypted. Unencrypted messages can be read by insiders at the corporation, by government agents requesting such information, or by hackers that can and often do get illegal access to them.\n\nA user cannot audit the way that a platform’s closed-source algorithm works. A Facebook user cannot send a direct message to a Twitter user. If an account is frozen or removed, a user can appeal but otherwise has no recourse. If social media is not allowed in a country, people have their information and connectivity greatly reduced and controlled by centralized forces.\n\nOpen-Source Social Media\n------------------------\n\nPeople have been trying to make more decentralized internet and social media experiences for a while, but it’s hard to compete with the network effects that the big centralized ones have established. A centralized server tends to be very efficient and self-reinforcing, and so centralized solutions get deployed, get the initial users, and thus entrench themselves for decades.\n\nOne of the ways to decentralize the internet is to normalize running a home server and make it easier to do so. As technology improves, basic server-grade computers have become more accessible, and a number of hardware and software solutions have come into existence that are geared towards a consumer server market. However, there are still long-term limitations on peoples’ interest or financial ability to run a server. The financial and bandwidth constraints are particularly problematic for potential users in developing countries.\n\nOn the other hand, some technologies enable more peer-to-peer information transfer. File-sharing, video calls, and things like that can allow people to connect to each other in high-bandwidth ways. Keet, for example, is far faster and higher resolution than Zoom for video chats involving modest amounts of people. A challenge with pure peer-to-peer models is that both users have to be online at the same time to coordinate.\n\nA middle-ground method that seems to be beginning to work at scale is the idea of distributed servers or “relays”. In this model, not every user has to run a server, but individual servers are relatively easy to run, are financially incentivized to be run, and are therefore numerous enough that there is no way to control or censor the network. The result is a rather decentralized web of servers that connect to each other, and users that connect to them.\n\nA good example of this is Nostr. It’s an open-source protocol that stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays”. For the first two years of its existence it was relatively unused, but in 2022 it started to get more traction. By the end of the year and into early 2023, thanks to efforts by Jack Dorsey and others, it started to gain some serious adoption.\n\n![Primal Nostr](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/primal-nostr.png)\n\n_Chart Source: [Primal.net](https://primal.net/explore)_\n\nOn top of Nostr, anyone can build a client application for it. Users of different clients can see each others’ posts and send messages to each other. A person can use different clients over time and still have access to their followers. One client might look kind of like Twitter. Another client might look kind of like Telegram. So far, clients that look like Twitter have been the preferred client type.\n\nThe closest analogy is perhaps to compare it to email. People who use Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL, and various individual webmail services, can all send emails to each other regardless of which service they use. This is because they are all built on the same underlying set of protocols, and are not closed/siloed systems.\n\nSimilarly, Nostr is an underlying open-source social media publishing protocol that people can build clients for. People have made Twitter-clone clients, Telegram-clone clients, desktop clients, and mobile clients for Nostr, and they are all compatible with each other.\n\n![Open Information Protocol](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/open-information-protocol-expanded.png)\n\nA nice attribute of this model is that if someone has a really good idea for a new type of social media platform, they don’t have to worry about network effects. They can create a new experience, meaning a new client interface, and connect it right into the Nostr protocol, and make it interoperable right from the start with every other Nostr user across existing clients. They can make use of the existing network effect, in a similar way that any new browser or new email provider makes use of the extensive network effect that already exists for those protocols.\n\nAnd it can extend beyond social media. Jack Dorsey has stressed this idea, and pointed out for example that it could be used as a Github replacement. The anonymous computer scientist and author Gigi has referred to it as an “identity and reputation layer”. Willy Woo described it as everything Twitter wanted in its early years with an open API. Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, pointed beyond Twitter clones and wrote that “an open messaging protocol means you can build things that weren’t previously possible in the old walled garden centralized paradigm”.\n\nTo use Nostr, you generate a private and public key pair in one of multiple ways. Most clients can do this for you, and third-party applications like Alby can do this for you. You keep the private key secret, and the public key is like your username that you share with other people.\n\nThere is no central server (or “relay”), and instead many individual users run relays. Users can pick which relays they connect to, and relay operators can ban certain users from their relay. Users publish material to multiple relays, and relays transmit and store that material, with discretion by relay operators about which material they choose to transmit and store on their particular relay.\n\nNostr makes native use of the Bitcoin/Lightning network, without being built on it. Users can easily tip each other with Lightning transactions or pay premium relay operators with Lightning payments in order to use those relays instead of the various free ones. Other paid services can be offered over Nostr as well.\n\nThe combination of public-key cryptography and distributed servers means that no central entity can censor anyone or ban anyone from the protocol, in a similar way that nobody can be “banned from email”. A government can target and shut down individual relays in their jurisdictions, but there could be quite a number of them, and individuals around the world can run relays, and users can connect to relays in other jurisdictions. Individual relay operators can choose to exclude things, and if users want to exclude certain things they can stick with those more exclusive relays. Some relays can operate for free and other ones can charge a small fee. Different client applications can configure different settings or appearances, and users can determine which clients to use, and use multiple different clients.\n\nIt also means that some of the user experience is a bit clunky at the moment. If a user doesn’t connect to good relays, the speed will be slow and some data will be incomplete, like seeing posts but being unable to see the posts that they are in response to. It’s not easy to track how many followers you precisely have, or how many likes a particular post really gets. Users have to be careful about which clients to trust- if you insert your private key into a scammy client, they can use it to capture your protocol-wide Nostr digital identity. The bandwidth usage in practice is rather high, particularly for developing country internet infrastructure- there has been a priority on making things work more than making things efficient.\n\nI expect that some of the clunky aspects will be smoothed out over time; at the moment the ecosystem is basically devoid of capital with a handful of people working on it, and yet it’s already quite impressive as it is. It looks like a powerful set of individual building blocks coming together. It’s really early.\n\nEven the bearish case for this technology is to say that it is something that will exist now but remain niche, and thus is a new tool that is usable by the people that need it.\n\nWhat Applications Require Global Consensus?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor many years now there has been a fad around the concept of “blockchain technology” as it relates to decentralization.\n\nSome of the big themes have been along these lines:\n\n*   Internet-Native Money\n*   Asset Tokenization\n*   Decentralized Media\n*   Digital Identity\n\nAll of those things, indeed, are important avenues of research. Bitcoin is a useful internet-native money. Stablecoins tokenize the dollar and make it more accessible to people around the world. Decentralized information protocols can give more people access to information and connections without centralized moderation or a centralized server to shut down. Digital identity gives someone the ability to prove themselves to be a continuous entity across different digital platforms and across time.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the idea of “Web3” has been used mainly as a marketing tool for the third and fourth items on that list. Anything with “decentralized” or “blockchain” as part of its claim has tended to get a lot of capital. Venture capital firms can deploy capital into a token project, pump up a lot of hype for it, encourage users to come into its ecosystem with ponzi-like financial characteristics, sell their tokens to retail investors after a couple years, and walk away with big gains regardless of the fact that the project had no long-term staying power.\n\nIn such an environment, user metrics are distorted due to there being so many financial incentives that are not necessarily in line with using the software for its own sake. The joke, therefore, is that “Web3 has more investors than users”. And the level of decentralization is often overstated as part of the marketing effort.\n\nA big issue here is that most platforms simply don’t need tokens, don’t benefit from tokens, and are made worse by having tokens.\n\nSure, existing securities or assets can be tokenized, and that can be useful. Tokenized dollars, tokenized stocks, tokenized receipts for things, etc. These are centralized assets, but their peer side is expanded into a bearer asset and tradeable globally by anyone with a smart phone. That’s a real use-case to people, although it does come with regulatory risks and counterparty risks.\n\nBut many decentralized things, and particularly platforms, are stronger without a token. The purpose of a token is often to enrich a smaller number of early creators or investors rather than to enhance the actual product or solve an actual problem. The existence of a token is often unnecessary and deleterious to a project. It’s often just a method of regulatory arbitrage to go around existing securities laws.\n\nAlong these lines, way more things are advertised as benefiting from a blockchain than really do. A blockchain helps different entities come to a global consensus on something, and that’s an expensive process that only needs to be applied to things that truly need it.\n\n**Global Consensus and Money:**\n\nAn example of something that truly needs global consensus is a shared global ledger, such as Bitcoin. In order to audit the supply of the Bitcoin network and validate all transactions, nodes need to agree on the full state of the ledger, globally and continuously. A blockchain solves this.\n\nBitcoin is like a big decentralized spreadsheet that the world comes to an agreement on every ten minutes, using energy from miners and the rules enforced by the user-run node network as its arbiters of truth. This is an expensive process, but a valuable one that isn’t solved by other means.\n\n**Global Consensus and Assets:**\n\nNext down the line is tokenized assets, such a stablecoins. The centralized issuer needs to know how many claims for their assets exist, and likely needs to be able to freeze individual ones and re-issue them as needed. On the other side, the user needs to be able to prove their claims of ownership to the issuer. It’s less critical (but potentially still desirable) for a user to be able to cheaply audit the entire supply of other user claims, since they are relying on a centralized issuer anyway.\n\nAnd then, issuers and users need composability: pieces need to be able to interact in many different ways relatively seamlessly for the ecosystem to be notably superior to the existing financial ecosystem. This gives users considerable flexibility over how they hold an asset, where they trade it, whether and where they leverage it as collateral, and so forth.\n\nSo far, this type of activity has benefited from a blockchain and a global consensus, although there are research efforts that suggest other avenues may exist. These can be thought of as methods to improve the tech wrapper for existing security issuers, exchanges, collectibles, liquidity/leverage services, and fiat payment services.\n\n**Global Consensus and Information:**\n\nFrom there, we get into decentralized communication and social media, and see that global consensus is not needed _or even desirable_.\n\nWe don’t come to a global consensus on “all emails” for example. Email providers make use of global protocols and yet there is no entity that needs to or has the technical capability to catalogue the current state of all emails globally. In fact, it would be a problem for privacy if they could.\n\nSimilarly, Nostr doesn’t require a global consensus, and thus is not a blockchain. Relays don’t need to all communicate with each other and ensure they all agree. Users don’t need to connect to every relay. The network is open-source and interoperable, and users can figure out how much of the network they want see based on how many relays they want to connect with, and how many people they want to follow.\n\nAttempts to use a blockchain as underlying technology for social media or similar types of internet experiences don’t make sense in my view, because the cost of coming to a global consensus is expensive, doesn’t necessarily add to the experience, and may detract from the experience.\n\n**Global Consensus and Identity:**\n\nLastly, digital identity also does not require global consensus.\n\nThe existence of a public/private key pair, for example, can be used to prove continuous identity (or at least continual ownership of the private key) across platforms and across time. Similarly, organizations or applications can provide more comprehensive identification services, and give the user the ability to selectively share part of that information with approved receivers of that information. Some of these applications may make use of a blockchain or a layer built on one.\n\nThere need not be a global consensus of all identities, nor would it necessarily be desirable if there were.\n\nA Combined Example: Money and Information\n-----------------------------------------\n\nI transferred some bitcoin from one of my old crypto exchange accounts to a mobile lightning wallet a while ago.\n\nIf I was in a developing country, even one where the banks don’t let me send money out to bitcoin brokerages or crypto exchanges, I could have earned the sats via [Stakwork](https://www.stakwork.com/) instead (Stakwork is a platform that, using the Lightning network, connects people who want microtasks done, to people able to do microtasks globally). Or, I could have acquired some with physical cash via [Azteco](https://azte.co/), a voucher system. Or with a peer-to-peer market like [Paxful](https://paxful.com/).\n\nI tend to play around with different wallets for research purposes, so I have both custodial and non-custodial varieties. One exercise I did to test different user interfaces is to quickly send some fractional bitcoin (commonly referred to as “sats”) from wallet to wallet on my own phone. Each transaction would take about three seconds. Bearer assets were jumping from custodial wallet to noncustodial wallet to custodial wallet to noncustodial wallet. Fees were a fraction of a penny, and the process was automated and within my control. I’ve also helped people download a wallet and send them some sats in a couple minutes.\n\nFrom there, I transferred some sats to my [Stacker News](https://stacker.news/) wallet, which took about three seconds. Stacker News is a Reddit-like website that requires paying sats to post, which helps prevent spam but is not actually expensive for human users. Users can tip each other with sats, and thus posting good content can earn you some sats. I transferred sats over to there so that I could post, and ended up receiving a bunch of tips on my posts.\n\nRecently, when trying out Nostr, I did something similar. I installed the [Alby plugin](https://getalby.com/) on my browser, and used it to create a new wallet. I transferred some of my Stacker News sats over to my Alby wallet, which took about three seconds. On my Nostr client, I listed my Alby wallet there. From that point, users could easily tip me some sats to my Alby wallet. I of course tipped some other people as well, and could pay for access to a premium relay. At any time, I can pull sats out of these ecosystems and into deeper cold storage; these custodial and noncustodial lightning wallets can be thought of as like cash in a wallet, with similar trade-offs as it relates to convenience and security.\n\nThe combination of an open monetary network and an open information network is pretty interesting. Programmable bearer asset money can move around frictionlessly across borders, and between platforms. Platforms can be interoperable with each other without directly working with each other to make it happen, simply because they are interfacing with the same underlying protocols. Server operators can be incentivized to maintain and enhance an information network via microtransactions.\n\nA set of protocols that globally connect people in terms of identity, information, and value can reduce a lot of frictions and create a lot of new opportunities.\n\nThe Battleground of Privacy\n---------------------------\n\nOpen commerce requires the transfer of both information and value. Therefore, both open monetary networks and open information networks (and their actual usage rather than merely their existence) matter for the study of economics, geopolitics, and various long-range investment outcomes.\n\nIn general, any jurisdiction that is attractive in the sense that people and capital want to come to it, and information can be shared freely within it and with the rest of the world, should welcome such technologies. Open monetary and information networks, especially if their usage spreads around the world in ways that are hard to prevent, enable and accelerate more value flowing into these freer jurisdictions from elsewhere. Borders become less relevant from an economic point of view.\n\nOn the other hand, any jurisdiction that is unattractive in the sense that people and capital want to escape it, and information is restricted within it and with the rest of the world in order to protect the rulers, should fear such technologies. Open monetary and information networks create more leaks of capital and information into and out of their jurisdictions, empowering their people, or forcing more expenditure by their rulers to increase the existing restrictions to maintain their isolation.\n\n**Financial Privacy on the Downtrend**\n\nIn older days, where exchange of cash or coin was more commonplace, transactional privacy was the default. As the world consolidated onto bank ledgers, however, privacy began to go away.\n\nThe 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, enacted into law by the US government and still in effect, compels banks to file reports with the government if a customer’s daily transactions exceed $10,000.\n\nWhen this law was enacted in 1970, the median American annual income was less than $10,000. So, the law only covered rather large sums of money moving within a day, worth well over $80,000 in today’s weaker dollars. However, there was no inflation adjustment embedded into the law. As the value of the dollar eroded over time, banks effectively had to file reports regarding smaller and smaller levels of transactions, since $10,000 worth of transactions occurring in a day became more and more commonplace. Every year, the government effectively lowers the threshold regarding its automatic financial surveillance, simply through inflation, without passing further legislation.\n\nOver the next fifty years, if the rate of inflation averages the same amount as it has over the past fifty years, then the reporting threshold will shrink by another 8x or so in terms of purchasing power. When the law was enacted, the government granted itself the ability to keep tabs on house-sized transactions. Over time, inflation enhanced the law so that they can keep track of transactions the size of used cars. If this keeps up, it will enable to them to keep track of transactions the size of lawnmowers or bicycles.\n\nThis is an example of expanding a surveillance mandate continuously, without having to pass new legislation to do so. Inflation serves as the ever-expanding mandate.\n\nOf course, with other technologies and surveillance methods, or with court orders, or with new legislation, authorities can already see any-sized bank transaction that they want as well.\n\n**Information Privacy on the Downtrend**\n\nPrivacy in communication, movement, and other aspects of life used to be expensive to violate. Prior to the widespread usage of the internet, smart phones, surveillance cameras, and other technologies, the only way to violate someone’s privacy was to physically spy on them, search their person, or search their property. And for this reason, the person who had their privacy violated had a good chance of knowing that it was violated.\n\nIn the digital age, it’s increasingly easy and inexpensive for governments, corporations, or individuals to violate someone’s privacy, and without that person knowing. For governments and corporations, a combination of public and private information on millions of people can be harvested automatically on all of the major digital platforms and portals. That data, once collected, can be organized by various Big Data techniques including machine learning, and then algorithmically monitored or made easily searchable to users of the database.\n\nIn 2013, a U.S. National Security Agency contractor named Edward Snowden leaked information to journalists that revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency’s surveillance capabilities extended far beyond what was previously known to the public. Specifically, the NSA was revealed to be able to directly tap into the systems of major telecommunications providers and large corporate software platforms to continually harvest information.\n\nIn one of the [original reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data) on the leak, the Guardian revealed:\n\n> The National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.\n> \n> The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called Prism, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.\n\nAs our lives become increasingly digital, it has become easier for our information to be harvested by corporations and governments. Privacy can be violated automatically, at scale, inexpensively, and without the user knowing.\n\nIn Western democracies this has downsides, but has so far been generally unfelt by the domestic population. Most of the humans rights violations committed by developed countries these days tend to be international, either from colonialism in the past or from neocolonialism in the present. In authoritarian regimes, however, the consequences are more domestic. People can be arrested for criticizing their government. People can be executed for being homosexual. People can be put into camps for having a minority religion.\n\nLast year, a young Saudi woman and mother of two children, who was a student at Leeds University in the United Kingdom, [was arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/saudi-woman-given-34-year-prison-sentence-for-using-twitter) when she returned home to Saudi Arabia and sentenced to 34 years in prison. Her crime was that she followed and retweeted various activists on Twitter, while she was in the United Kingdom. A couple of months later, a 72-year old Saudi-American dual citizen living in the United States [was arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/18/saudi-arabia-us-citizen-prison-critical-tweets-regime) and sentenced to 16 years in prison when he returned to Saudi Arabia for what was supposed to be a brief trip. His crime was that he tweeted critically about the Saudi regime while in the United States.\n\nThis also happens to people in countries that are popular tourist destinations. People have been given [25-year prison sentences in Thailand](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-politics/thai-man-jailed-for-25-years-over-royal-insult-posts-on-facebook-idUSKBN0MR13720150331) for posting pictures online that are deemed insulting to the country’s monarchy. Ahmed Monsoor was sentenced to prison for a decade for advocating for human rights in the UAE in a way that was critical of the rulers. As [Human Rights Watch reported](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/01/27/persecution-ahmed-mansoor/how-united-arab-emirates-silenced-its-most-famous-human):\n\n> At his third hearing, the judge read out six charges against Mansoor, all entirely based on his human rights activism and advocacy. The court later convicted him of five of those charges, all based on simple acts of human rights advocacy, including tweeting about injustices, participating in international human rights conferences online, and (since deleted) email exchanges and WhatsApp conversations with representatives of human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR). The court acquitted him of the sixth charge, “cooperating with a terrorist organization.”\n> \n> The court based its verdict, announced during the fifth and final hearing, on the penal code and the 2012 cybercrimes law, both of which make the peaceful expression of critical views of the authorities, senior officials, the judiciary, and even public policy a criminal offense and provide a legal basis to prosecute and jail people who argue for political reform or organize unlicensed demonstrations.\n\nOver 1.4 billion people have information suppressed in China and are subject to varying levels of authoritarianism. India, another country of 1.4 billion people is much less restrictive, but still gets information removed from social media and has a mixed human rights track record. Hundreds of millions of people across parts of the Middle East and parts of southeast Asia are subject to authoritarian rule. Vladimir Putin’s political opposition, [Alexei Navalny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny), was poisoned, and upon surviving and returning to Russia, was put in prison and remains there until this day. A subset of Latin American countries and African countries have authoritarian rule. It’s an extremely widespread problem. Meanwhile, institutions that are largely run by developed countries, such as the IMF, gladly work with authoritarian regimes, which can help keep them in power.\n\nOne of the defenses that people have against authoritarianism is private, encrypted communication and information. This allows for the transfer of information and value, including in private ways. Technologies such as this will rarely be provided in a top-down way; instead if they are to exist and be resilient, they must be built in a bottom-up and highly distributed way.\n\nAlong the way, such technologies will be painted as tools of drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and terrorists by those who are in power. And what will complicate matters is that yes, just like pagers, just like the internet, and just like any powerful technology or network, criminals will be among those that use such tools. And yet, those tools are necessary, and can help far more people than they can hurt.\n\n**The Long Debate**\n\nAuthoritarian regimes have often turned to obvious anti-privacy techniques in order to prevent revolutions. Such regimes want to control the spread of information as much as possible.\n\nIn Western democracies, anti-privacy crackdowns have instead been more gradual, and have generally existed on the institutional level rather than the consumer level. It’s easier to get several thousand highly-regulated banks and a few dozen major internet platforms and telecommunication companies to comply with continuous financial and information surveillance than it is to get hundreds of millions of individuals to do so.\n\nWe generally have a rolling set of reasons for why privacy needs to be violated in such a continuous, systemic, and automated way. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, it was often argued that financial and information privacy must be restricted in order to restrain drug trafficking. Back in the 1980s, for example, pagers were a source of consternation:\n\n> Although paging devices, or beepers, have grown in popularity throughout the labor force — doctors, delivery people and journalists often use them — they also have become a staple in the drug business, posing fresh problems for law enforcement and threatening to tarnish the image of a booming high-tech industry.\n> \n> \\-Washington Post, 1988, “[Message is Out on Beepers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/07/11/message-is-out-on-beepers/58840caa-523e-413b-9224-60ad94d7803f/)“\n\nStarting in the 2000s, it was terrorism financing that took center stage instead. The 2001 [Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act), among other things, expanded surveillance capabilities by the U.S. government in the name of fighting terrorism. The NSA’s programs in the 2010s, revealed by Snowden, further expanded and automated that capability by connecting with major internet messaging platforms and aggregating as much online communication as possible.\n\nMore recently, the public messaging around restrictions on privacy have been about child imagery and/or sanctioned nation states. Throughout 2022, the European Commission [proposed legislation](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-propose-law-fight-child-sexual-abuse-online/) that would try to eliminate all private communications by mandating the automatic scanning of emails and messages, including encrypted messages, for certain types of illegal content. While everyone is of course against the existence and distribution of such dreadful imagery, the idea that every communication method of all citizens must be continuously scanned and made accessible to the government is argued by many to be an extreme overreach. Similarly, the [U.S. Treasury sanctioning of Tornado Cash](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) was a crackdown on cryptographic privacy methods due to its association with DeFi hacks, including by North Korea. Any entity that handles funds on a commercial scale has do various identity checks, and so various centralized private custodians tend to be regularly shut down. In the modern era, unlike the past, financial privacy is considered to be synonymous with money laundering.\n\nAnother problem relates to tax collection. Back in older times when transactions were more inherently private, something like an income tax was relatively unworkable. Taxes tended to be placed on property and on exports/imports, and on income for large establishments or estates, because all of that was quite visible and auditable. In contrast, taxing income at the individual level was generally a messy proposition due to the difficulty and expense of auditing it. Even today, accurately taxing cash-dominated businesses remains a challenge.\n\nHowever, with the widespread conversion towards bank ledgers and automatic employer paychecks, it became easier for governments to audit incomes and to tax them. Employers pay their employees, report the payouts to the government, and the whole process is auditable. Income taxes thus became a dominant form of taxation.\n\nGoing forward, if a meaningful portion of the economy shifts towards peer-to-peer global gig work, and money and information in general become more encrypted and private, and money is able to be self-custodied and moved around globally, then what does that mean for governments’ ability to audit incomes and impose taxation on those incomes at the individual level? Such auditing and assessment could become much more expensive, and for sophisticated users, potentially becomes impossible.\n\nOne perspective would be that governments simply have to change their patterns of taxation over time, if indeed bottom-up open-source distributed privacy technology and open monetary/information networks become more widespread. In some sense, this would be a return to how things used to be, except in the digital realm. A greater portion of taxation would have to be on more physical, large, and visible things, such as property, major enterprise, and the logistics and sale points of physical products.\n\nThe other perspective, generally from the viewpoint of government, is that instead all privacy has to be eliminated, then. Every transaction between every peer, globally, has to be monitorable so that it can be audited and taxed. Even if an open-source bottom-up emergent technology is developed to enable privacy, such technology must be outlawed and/or marginalized as much as possible to prevent its widespread use. It may even be necessary to place more restrictions on the developers of such technology, as the [Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act essentially proposed](https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/the-digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-is-an-opportunistic-unconstitutional-assault-on-cryptocurrency-self-custody-developers-and-node-operators/).\n\nUnfortunately, this second perspective takes on a very different meaning when we remember that billions of people live under authoritarianism, and that people can readily be arrested and sentenced to long prison terms for criticizing their government, organizing protests, having the wrong sexual orientation, having the wrong religion, or otherwise having some minority or disapproved aspect of their life.\n\nOver the long run, I view the outcome, one way or the other, more as a matter of technology than politics. From the top-down side there is the development of Big Data and automated data-surveillance capabilities. From the bottom-up side there is the development of encryption tools and open monetary/information networks. Whichever direction proves more powerful will play a major role in how all sorts of things operate in the decades ahead, including various economic interactions.\n\nTherefore, for proponents of privacy and open networks to win becomes a matter of making the technology easy to use, too costly to stamp out, and well understood by the public. For proponents of ubiquitous surveillance to win becomes a matter of convincing the public that privacy is undesirable and that these tools are not needed or are dangerous, while enhancing their data collection and sorting capabilities.\n\nAnd from an analyst perspective, the challenge and the opportunity is to see where these trends are headed, which means monitoring the progress of both the bottom-up an the top-down approaches to see who is in the lead.","created_at":1681943220,"id":"c6e3d6d17cd55aca652457e0bb5873f22a5a822828dafda648ce6d350e1d5823","kind":9802,"pubkey":"958b754a1d3de5b5eca0fe31d2d555f451325f8498a83da1997b7fcd5c39e88c","sig":"88c17c54cc25e122acba16161ef32c58b924fbf9f914646b3a47371d5c4410e74bc113f3bbec17c6d69cdaa2d7b8d15ad1682414bb10848c854945a0ad8e9563","tags":[["title","Implications of Open Monetary and Information Networks"],["textContent","Published: April 2023\nRecent decades have been characterized primarily by closed systems, both financially and online.\nThe financial system as we know it has been a rather closed system for ages, consisting of various silos. Banks and brokerages operate permissioned ledgers. Opening accounts with institutions is a permissioned activity. Sending assets between institutions is a permissioned activity domestically, and especially globally. The base currency itself has a central issuer.\nThe internet had many open aspects early on, and still does, but it largely consolidated into silos over time. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, and platforms like these are closed networks. Opening accounts with them is a permissioned activity, how you use them is a permissioned activity, and sending information between these platforms has generally not been possible. How exactly do their algorithms work? Since most of them are closed, we can’t know.\nToday, open monetary protocols (e.g. Bitcoin), as well as the emergence of newer open information protocols (e.g. Nostr), challenge this state of affairs and/or present alternative parallel systems for which people globally can use, explore, and build on. This article examines some of the prospects and potential implications of their adoption.\nClosed-Source Money\nBank accounts give users access to the traditional globally-connected banking system. A global network of interconnected banks allow for domestic and global money exchange, with varying amounts of settlement time for those transactions.\nIn recent decades, various fintech companies have developed as layers on top of traditional banking rails, to modernize and quicken the process of sending money. Contrary to popular perception, these types of companies aren’t going around banks or competing with banks; they are layers on top of the existing banking apparatus that still make use of various banks with central bank connections, but in a way that abstracts the experience for the user.\nWith credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, and others- an increasing number of methods to move around small or medium amounts of money have greatly decreased digital payment times from the user perspective. Behind the scenes, however, there is still a complex and slow backend financial handshaking process that occurs along the way, as various intermediate financial institutions take on temporary credit.\nIn other words, when a small fintech payment seems instantly finished from the user perspective, the banks in the background are still spending hours or days finalizing it behind the curtain in larger batches, and thus holding IOUs to each other in the process.\nReliably sending global payments is much more burdensome, slow, and expensive. Wire transfers often get caught up and delayed in opaque ways. Many fintech services are only available in one economic bloc, such as the United States, and have no ability to send foreign payments. To the extent that a bank or service allows for global payments, it can feel like a stressful event each time, as you wonder if it will go through or get blocked for some arcane reason and need to be re-attempted, thus wasting time.\nMy local credit union used to offer international wire transfers (by piggy-backing on Bank of America for the infrastructure, and for quite a hefty fee) but now no longer does. I have to use my Big Bank account now, when sending global wires.\nThere’s an unfortunate problem for global payments: small transactions tend to have the highest percent fees, and their payees and recipients can least afford it. Many people in developing countries travel internationally for work and send money home to their families in small amounts, with intermediaries collecting high fees and not innovating quickly (or at all) to reduce them, and with little incentive to do so. According to the World Bank, the average fee percentage on a remittance payment is 6.3%. When sending remittance payments directly with banks, the fee percentage is 11.7%. Fintech companies and mobile payment solutions are responsible for lowering the average, but the average is still very high.\nGlobally, only about 76% of people have an account at a bank or at a fintech platform that connects to a bank. In many countries and regions, the numbers remain very low. In Nigeria, for example, only 45% of people have an account. In Palestine, only 34% do. Having a physical bank branch is expensive, and providing manual customer service comes with substantial overhead costs. If someone has a few hundred dollars, it is usually not worth the bank’s time to give them an account.\nAccording to the World Bank, 75 countries also still have restrictions on women’s rights to manage assets. So, in addition to technical or monopoly-like problems with sending or holding money, there are some social bottlenecks as well.\nFurthermore, many people aren’t aware of the problematic combination of refugees and banking. Banking is a centralized and permissioned activity, governed by a nation’s central bank, with tight regulation. This almost always involves mandating that the banks collect identification on customers. However, many refugees from impoverished or war-torn regions don’t have IDs, and don’t have a clear or convenient path towards getting one, depending on the jurisdiction they’ve fled to. The problem is further compounded if they don’t have enough money or income for a bank to care.\nMeanwhile, over 86% of people (over 7.1 billion people) have a smartphone globally, and the percentage is rising quickly. The proliferation and exponential nature of technology has allowed smart phone usage to leapfrog banking access in many areas. Phone and mobile internet adoption is expected to continue to spread into poorer and poorer areas over the next five and ten years.\nPeople who work in what society considers to be undesirable industries often have trouble getting banked, or tend to get de-banked (including by fintech companies) after already being banked. Even the mere process of spreading information can lead to de-banking, such as the well-known case of Wikileaks losing its fintech payment platform access in 2010. If a protest is considered unacceptable, whether it’s in Nigeria or Canada or wherever else, protestors may have their bank accounts frozen, donations to protestors may be frozen or reversed, and even those making donations may find their financial access frozen.\nAnd we must consider this from a global perspective: billions of people live in authoritarian countries and the number is no longer improving:\n\nChart Source: Freedom House 2023 Report\nOpen-Source Money\nFor decades since at least the early 1980s, cryptographers and cypherpunks researched ways to build internet-native monies that go around the banking system. Many early implementations were centralized, and thus either failed to accrue a network effect and stagnated into bankruptcy, or were actively shut down by the government.\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto built on prior work and launched what has thus far been the most successful open-source monetary network: Bitcoin. For 14 years and counting, it has provided an open (yet still rather niche) payments and savings network to anyone with an internet connection, and in a way that has thus far been able to maintain decentralization and resistance to censorship. A subset of analysts around the world continue to examine it to determine 1) whether it will continue to exist and remain functional and 2) what implications it may have if it does.\n\nNobody can reverse or censor transactions by decree; the only way to do so is to gain 51% of the network’s processing power and override the rest of the network. And since it’s an open-source network with nobody in charge, anyone with the physical capability to do so can interact with it in various ways:\n-A user can run a free open-source node client and participate in running the network, sending permissionless payments, and auditing details of the protocol.\n-Without even using software, a user can generate a private key by flipping a coin 256 times and use it to receive bitcoin as payments.\n-A user can memorize twelve words, travel across the world, and be able to reconstruct their ability to access their bitcoin at a later date.\n-A programmer can make a non-custodial wallet application that interfaces with the network and makes interacting with it easier for a non-technical user.\n-A financial services company can operate as a custodian, or as a collaborative custody provider that holds a 1-of-3 backup key in a multi-signature arrangement while the user holds 2-of-3 keys.\nWhen we look at a closed monetary network such as the Federal Reserve system, it is strictly hierarchical. The underlying settlement networks, such as Fedwire, are only accessible to banks. To the extent that a user wants to make use of it, they can only do so indirectly, by being a customer at a bank or a fintech company that connects to a bank. To the extent that a fintech developer or a new bank figures out a way to make access to the network better, they can only do so with permission, by being granted access to a bank and following all regulations which vary by jurisdiction. The recent denial of Custodia Bank’s application is a recent example to show how permissioned and hierarchical the system is.\n\nAn open monetary network works differently. Users can directly access the network if they want to. Or they can go through larger platforms that make various trade-offs for the sake of convenience. Furthermore, people can directly interact with whatever part of the stack that suits their specific needs at a specific time, such as the base layer or software layers on top of it (e.g. Lightning). Any developer can create a new way to interface with it, or a new layer on top of it, and offer it into the global marketplace without waiting for an application to a centralized authority to be approved.\n\nClosed-Source Social Media\nOn its surface, the internet seems reasonably decentralized. A consistent protocol stack built around Internet Protocol is used around the world, and on top of that protocol stack there are various websites or other types of servers, and there are multiple different methods to access them (e.g. different operating systems, browser applications, and so forth).\nThe ways that people tend to use it, however, have become quite controllable and siloed. The rise of major social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others consolidated many users into big pools of connectivity. Rather than everyone making their own websites, most users create accounts on big platforms, and thus subject themselves to the various rules and algorithms of that platform in exchange for the convenience and access that those platforms provide. Billions of people congregate around these pools of activity, which are offered for free in exchange for harvesting all of their data. Small and separately-run internet forum websites used to be popular, but these have tended to consolidate towards subsections of major social media platforms. To the extent that people search for new websites, it’s dominated by Google’s search algorithm.\nA Twitter user can’t send a direct message to a Facebook user. A LinkedIn user can’t bring their followers with them if they create a Twitter account. They all tend to be siloed.\n\nThose platforms then use various private algorithms to determine what information gets shown to users, and have discretion around content moderation policies to remove posts or entire accounts as they deem fit, or as required to by their government.\nWe can imagine this from a corporate, government, and user perspective, and see what each one is trying to maximize for.\nFrom a corporation’s perspective, they need to be able to remove illegal activity or outright spam, so that they can comply with laws and so that their platform doesn’t turn into a tragedy of the commons. They also need to tune their algorithm in such a way that it gives people the connections that make sense to them, and keep them on the platform rather than going elsewhere.\nFrom a government’s perspective, people act very differently online than offline. They are more impersonal, more aggressive, and easier to manipulate with fake data (including via foreign agents) when online. Algorithms, if improperly tuned, can feed a billion people more of what makes them emotional from people who are already in their digital tribe, and thus close them off from each other and repeatedly exaggerate public outrage in recurring waves.\nFrom a user’s perspective, government and corporate power over moderation is prone to corruption. A government can demand a takedown of information that is inconvenient to them or that doesn’t fit their preferred narrative. Corporations can exacerbate outrage and user emotions if it translates into more dollars at the end of the day. Much like the military-industrial complex that has been around for decades, there is a political-finance-media complex as well.\nIndia, as a very large but relatively mild example, has established a track record of telling Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms to remove information that is unfavorable towards their current administration, and those platforms comply. In many countries that are more restrictive, social media platforms are completely controlled or banned, leaving their population in the dark and disconnected from the rest of the world.\nEven private messages can be read by those in power. Some platforms use unencrypted direct messages. Other platforms claim to use encrypted direct messages, but there is no way for a user to prove that they really are encrypted. Unencrypted messages can be read by insiders at the corporation, by government agents requesting such information, or by hackers that can and often do get illegal access to them.\nA user cannot audit the way that a platform’s closed-source algorithm works. A Facebook user cannot send a direct message to a Twitter user. If an account is frozen or removed, a user can appeal but otherwise has no recourse. If social media is not allowed in a country, people have their information and connectivity greatly reduced and controlled by centralized forces.\nOpen-Source Social Media\nPeople have been trying to make more decentralized internet and social media experiences for a while, but it’s hard to compete with the network effects that the big centralized ones have established. A centralized server tends to be very efficient and self-reinforcing, and so centralized solutions get deployed, get the initial users, and thus entrench themselves for decades.\nOne of the ways to decentralize the internet is to normalize running a home server and make it easier to do so. As technology improves, basic server-grade computers have become more accessible, and a number of hardware and software solutions have come into existence that are geared towards a consumer server market. However, there are still long-term limitations on peoples’ interest or financial ability to run a server. The financial and bandwidth constraints are particularly problematic for potential users in developing countries.\nOn the other hand, some technologies enable more peer-to-peer information transfer. File-sharing, video calls, and things like that can allow people to connect to each other in high-bandwidth ways. Keet, for example, is far faster and higher resolution than Zoom for video chats involving modest amounts of people. A challenge with pure peer-to-peer models is that both users have to be online at the same time to coordinate.\nA middle-ground method that seems to be beginning to work at scale is the idea of distributed servers or “relays”. In this model, not every user has to run a server, but individual servers are relatively easy to run, are financially incentivized to be run, and are therefore numerous enough that there is no way to control or censor the network. The result is a rather decentralized web of servers that connect to each other, and users that connect to them.\nA good example of this is Nostr. It’s an open-source protocol that stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays”. For the first two years of its existence it was relatively unused, but in 2022 it started to get more traction. By the end of the year and into early 2023, thanks to efforts by Jack Dorsey and others, it started to gain some serious adoption.\n\nChart Source: Primal.net\nOn top of Nostr, anyone can build a client application for it. Users of different clients can see each others’ posts and send messages to each other. A person can use different clients over time and still have access to their followers. One client might look kind of like Twitter. Another client might look kind of like Telegram. So far, clients that look like Twitter have been the preferred client type.\nThe closest analogy is perhaps to compare it to email. People who use Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL, and various individual webmail services, can all send emails to each other regardless of which service they use. This is because they are all built on the same underlying set of protocols, and are not closed/siloed systems.\nSimilarly, Nostr is an underlying open-source social media publishing protocol that people can build clients for. People have made Twitter-clone clients, Telegram-clone clients, desktop clients, and mobile clients for Nostr, and they are all compatible with each other.\n\nA nice attribute of this model is that if someone has a really good idea for a new type of social media platform, they don’t have to worry about network effects. They can create a new experience, meaning a new client interface, and connect it right into the Nostr protocol, and make it interoperable right from the start with every other Nostr user across existing clients. They can make use of the existing network effect, in a similar way that any new browser or new email provider makes use of the extensive network effect that already exists for those protocols.\nAnd it can extend beyond social media. Jack Dorsey has stressed this idea, and pointed out for example that it could be used as a Github replacement. The anonymous computer scientist and author Gigi has referred to it as an “identity and reputation layer”. Willy Woo described it as everything Twitter wanted in its early years with an open API. Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, pointed beyond Twitter clones and wrote that “an open messaging protocol means you can build things that weren’t previously possible in the old walled garden centralized paradigm”.\nTo use Nostr, you generate a private and public key pair in one of multiple ways. Most clients can do this for you, and third-party applications like Alby can do this for you. You keep the private key secret, and the public key is like your username that you share with other people.\nThere is no central server (or “relay”), and instead many individual users run relays. Users can pick which relays they connect to, and relay operators can ban certain users from their relay. Users publish material to multiple relays, and relays transmit and store that material, with discretion by relay operators about which material they choose to transmit and store on their particular relay.\nNostr makes native use of the Bitcoin/Lightning network, without being built on it. Users can easily tip each other with Lightning transactions or pay premium relay operators with Lightning payments in order to use those relays instead of the various free ones. Other paid services can be offered over Nostr as well.\nThe combination of public-key cryptography and distributed servers means that no central entity can censor anyone or ban anyone from the protocol, in a similar way that nobody can be “banned from email”. A government can target and shut down individual relays in their jurisdictions, but there could be quite a number of them, and individuals around the world can run relays, and users can connect to relays in other jurisdictions. Individual relay operators can choose to exclude things, and if users want to exclude certain things they can stick with those more exclusive relays. Some relays can operate for free and other ones can charge a small fee. Different client applications can configure different settings or appearances, and users can determine which clients to use, and use multiple different clients.\nIt also means that some of the user experience is a bit clunky at the moment. If a user doesn’t connect to good relays, the speed will be slow and some data will be incomplete, like seeing posts but being unable to see the posts that they are in response to. It’s not easy to track how many followers you precisely have, or how many likes a particular post really gets. Users have to be careful about which clients to trust- if you insert your private key into a scammy client, they can use it to capture your protocol-wide Nostr digital identity. The bandwidth usage in practice is rather high, particularly for developing country internet infrastructure- there has been a priority on making things work more than making things efficient.\nI expect that some of the clunky aspects will be smoothed out over time; at the moment the ecosystem is basically devoid of capital with a handful of people working on it, and yet it’s already quite impressive as it is. It looks like a powerful set of individual building blocks coming together. It’s really early.\nEven the bearish case for this technology is to say that it is something that will exist now but remain niche, and thus is a new tool that is usable by the people that need it.\nWhat Applications Require Global Consensus?\nFor many years now there has been a fad around the concept of “blockchain technology” as it relates to decentralization.\nSome of the big themes have been along these lines:\n\nInternet-Native Money\nAsset Tokenization\nDecentralized Media\nDigital Identity\n\nAll of those things, indeed, are important avenues of research. Bitcoin is a useful internet-native money. Stablecoins tokenize the dollar and make it more accessible to people around the world. Decentralized information protocols can give more people access to information and connections without centralized moderation or a centralized server to shut down. Digital identity gives someone the ability to prove themselves to be a continuous entity across different digital platforms and across time.\nHowever, in recent years, the idea of “Web3” has been used mainly as a marketing tool for the third and fourth items on that list. Anything with “decentralized” or “blockchain” as part of its claim has tended to get a lot of capital. Venture capital firms can deploy capital into a token project, pump up a lot of hype for it, encourage users to come into its ecosystem with ponzi-like financial characteristics, sell their tokens to retail investors after a couple years, and walk away with big gains regardless of the fact that the project had no long-term staying power.\nIn such an environment, user metrics are distorted due to there being so many financial incentives that are not necessarily in line with using the software for its own sake. The joke, therefore, is that “Web3 has more investors than users”. And the level of decentralization is often overstated as part of the marketing effort.\nA big issue here is that most platforms simply don’t need tokens, don’t benefit from tokens, and are made worse by having tokens.\nSure, existing securities or assets can be tokenized, and that can be useful. Tokenized dollars, tokenized stocks, tokenized receipts for things, etc. These are centralized assets, but their peer side is expanded into a bearer asset and tradeable globally by anyone with a smart phone. That’s a real use-case to people, although it does come with regulatory risks and counterparty risks.\nBut many decentralized things, and particularly platforms, are stronger without a token. The purpose of a token is often to enrich a smaller number of early creators or investors rather than to enhance the actual product or solve an actual problem. The existence of a token is often unnecessary and deleterious to a project. It’s often just a method of regulatory arbitrage to go around existing securities laws.\nAlong these lines, way more things are advertised as benefiting from a blockchain than really do. A blockchain helps different entities come to a global consensus on something, and that’s an expensive process that only needs to be applied to things that truly need it.\nGlobal Consensus and Money:\nAn example of something that truly needs global consensus is a shared global ledger, such as Bitcoin. In order to audit the supply of the Bitcoin network and validate all transactions, nodes need to agree on the full state of the ledger, globally and continuously. A blockchain solves this.\nBitcoin is like a big decentralized spreadsheet that the world comes to an agreement on every ten minutes, using energy from miners and the rules enforced by the user-run node network as its arbiters of truth. This is an expensive process, but a valuable one that isn’t solved by other means.\nGlobal Consensus and Assets:\nNext down the line is tokenized assets, such a stablecoins. The centralized issuer needs to know how many claims for their assets exist, and likely needs to be able to freeze individual ones and re-issue them as needed. On the other side, the user needs to be able to prove their claims of ownership to the issuer. It’s less critical (but potentially still desirable) for a user to be able to cheaply audit the entire supply of other user claims, since they are relying on a centralized issuer anyway.\nAnd then, issuers and users need composability: pieces need to be able to interact in many different ways relatively seamlessly for the ecosystem to be notably superior to the existing financial ecosystem. This gives users considerable flexibility over how they hold an asset, where they trade it, whether and where they leverage it as collateral, and so forth.\nSo far, this type of activity has benefited from a blockchain and a global consensus, although there are research efforts that suggest other avenues may exist. These can be thought of as methods to improve the tech wrapper for existing security issuers, exchanges, collectibles, liquidity/leverage services, and fiat payment services.\nGlobal Consensus and Information:\nFrom there, we get into decentralized communication and social media, and see that global consensus is not needed or even desirable.\nWe don’t come to a global consensus on “all emails” for example. Email providers make use of global protocols and yet there is no entity that needs to or has the technical capability to catalogue the current state of all emails globally. In fact, it would be a problem for privacy if they could.\nSimilarly, Nostr doesn’t require a global consensus, and thus is not a blockchain. Relays don’t need to all communicate with each other and ensure they all agree. Users don’t need to connect to every relay. The network is open-source and interoperable, and users can figure out how much of the network they want see based on how many relays they want to connect with, and how many people they want to follow.\nAttempts to use a blockchain as underlying technology for social media or similar types of internet experiences don’t make sense in my view, because the cost of coming to a global consensus is expensive, doesn’t necessarily add to the experience, and may detract from the experience.\nGlobal Consensus and Identity:\nLastly, digital identity also does not require global consensus.\nThe existence of a public/private key pair, for example, can be used to prove continuous identity (or at least continual ownership of the private key) across platforms and across time. Similarly, organizations or applications can provide more comprehensive identification services, and give the user the ability to selectively share part of that information with approved receivers of that information. Some of these applications may make use of a blockchain or a layer built on one.\nThere need not be a global consensus of all identities, nor would it necessarily be desirable if there were.\nA Combined Example: Money and Information\nI transferred some bitcoin from one of my old crypto exchange accounts to a mobile lightning wallet a while ago.\nIf I was in a developing country, even one where the banks don’t let me send money out to bitcoin brokerages or crypto exchanges, I could have earned the sats via Stakwork instead (Stakwork is a platform that, using the Lightning network, connects people who want microtasks done, to people able to do microtasks globally). Or, I could have acquired some with physical cash via Azteco, a voucher system. Or with a peer-to-peer market like Paxful.\nI tend to play around with different wallets for research purposes, so I have both custodial and non-custodial varieties. One exercise I did to test different user interfaces is to quickly send some fractional bitcoin (commonly referred to as “sats”) from wallet to wallet on my own phone. Each transaction would take about three seconds. Bearer assets were jumping from custodial wallet to noncustodial wallet to custodial wallet to noncustodial wallet. Fees were a fraction of a penny, and the process was automated and within my control. I’ve also helped people download a wallet and send them some sats in a couple minutes.\nFrom there, I transferred some sats to my Stacker News wallet, which took about three seconds. Stacker News is a Reddit-like website that requires paying sats to post, which helps prevent spam but is not actually expensive for human users. Users can tip each other with sats, and thus posting good content can earn you some sats. I transferred sats over to there so that I could post, and ended up receiving a bunch of tips on my posts.\nRecently, when trying out Nostr, I did something similar. I installed the Alby plugin on my browser, and used it to create a new wallet. I transferred some of my Stacker News sats over to my Alby wallet, which took about three seconds. On my Nostr client, I listed my Alby wallet there. From that point, users could easily tip me some sats to my Alby wallet. I of course tipped some other people as well, and could pay for access to a premium relay. At any time, I can pull sats out of these ecosystems and into deeper cold storage; these custodial and noncustodial lightning wallets can be thought of as like cash in a wallet, with similar trade-offs as it relates to convenience and security.\nThe combination of an open monetary network and an open information network is pretty interesting. Programmable bearer asset money can move around frictionlessly across borders, and between platforms. Platforms can be interoperable with each other without directly working with each other to make it happen, simply because they are interfacing with the same underlying protocols. Server operators can be incentivized to maintain and enhance an information network via microtransactions.\nA set of protocols that globally connect people in terms of identity, information, and value can reduce a lot of frictions and create a lot of new opportunities.\nThe Battleground of Privacy\nOpen commerce requires the transfer of both information and value. Therefore, both open monetary networks and open information networks (and their actual usage rather than merely their existence) matter for the study of economics, geopolitics, and various long-range investment outcomes.\nIn general, any jurisdiction that is attractive in the sense that people and capital want to come to it, and information can be shared freely within it and with the rest of the world, should welcome such technologies. Open monetary and information networks, especially if their usage spreads around the world in ways that are hard to prevent, enable and accelerate more value flowing into these freer jurisdictions from elsewhere. Borders become less relevant from an economic point of view.\nOn the other hand, any jurisdiction that is unattractive in the sense that people and capital want to escape it, and information is restricted within it and with the rest of the world in order to protect the rulers, should fear such technologies. Open monetary and information networks create more leaks of capital and information into and out of their jurisdictions, empowering their people, or forcing more expenditure by their rulers to increase the existing restrictions to maintain their isolation.\nFinancial Privacy on the Downtrend\nIn older days, where exchange of cash or coin was more commonplace, transactional privacy was the default. As the world consolidated onto bank ledgers, however, privacy began to go away.\nThe 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, enacted into law by the US government and still in effect, compels banks to file reports with the government if a customer’s daily transactions exceed $10,000.\nWhen this law was enacted in 1970, the median American annual income was less than $10,000. So, the law only covered rather large sums of money moving within a day, worth well over $80,000 in today’s weaker dollars. However, there was no inflation adjustment embedded into the law. As the value of the dollar eroded over time, banks effectively had to file reports regarding smaller and smaller levels of transactions, since $10,000 worth of transactions occurring in a day became more and more commonplace. Every year, the government effectively lowers the threshold regarding its automatic financial surveillance, simply through inflation, without passing further legislation.\nOver the next fifty years, if the rate of inflation averages the same amount as it has over the past fifty years, then the reporting threshold will shrink by another 8x or so in terms of purchasing power. When the law was enacted, the government granted itself the ability to keep tabs on house-sized transactions. Over time, inflation enhanced the law so that they can keep track of transactions the size of used cars. If this keeps up, it will enable to them to keep track of transactions the size of lawnmowers or bicycles.\nThis is an example of expanding a surveillance mandate continuously, without having to pass new legislation to do so. Inflation serves as the ever-expanding mandate.\nOf course, with other technologies and surveillance methods, or with court orders, or with new legislation, authorities can already see any-sized bank transaction that they want as well.\nInformation Privacy on the Downtrend\nPrivacy in communication, movement, and other aspects of life used to be expensive to violate. Prior to the widespread usage of the internet, smart phones, surveillance cameras, and other technologies, the only way to violate someone’s privacy was to physically spy on them, search their person, or search their property. And for this reason, the person who had their privacy violated had a good chance of knowing that it was violated.\nIn the digital age, it’s increasingly easy and inexpensive for governments, corporations, or individuals to violate someone’s privacy, and without that person knowing. For governments and corporations, a combination of public and private information on millions of people can be harvested automatically on all of the major digital platforms and portals. That data, once collected, can be organized by various Big Data techniques including machine learning, and then algorithmically monitored or made easily searchable to users of the database.\nIn 2013, a U.S. National Security Agency contractor named Edward Snowden leaked information to journalists that revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency’s surveillance capabilities extended far beyond what was previously known to the public. Specifically, the NSA was revealed to be able to directly tap into the systems of major telecommunications providers and large corporate software platforms to continually harvest information.\nIn one of the original reports on the leak, the Guardian revealed:\n\nThe National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.\nThe NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called Prism, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.\n\nAs our lives become increasingly digital, it has become easier for our information to be harvested by corporations and governments. Privacy can be violated automatically, at scale, inexpensively, and without the user knowing.\nIn Western democracies this has downsides, but has so far been generally unfelt by the domestic population. Most of the humans rights violations committed by developed countries these days tend to be international, either from colonialism in the past or from neocolonialism in the present. In authoritarian regimes, however, the consequences are more domestic. People can be arrested for criticizing their government. People can be executed for being homosexual. People can be put into camps for having a minority religion.\nLast year, a young Saudi woman and mother of two children, who was a student at Leeds University in the United Kingdom, was arrested when she returned home to Saudi Arabia and sentenced to 34 years in prison. Her crime was that she followed and retweeted various activists on Twitter, while she was in the United Kingdom. A couple of months later, a 72-year old Saudi-American dual citizen living in the United States was arrested and sentenced to 16 years in prison when he returned to Saudi Arabia for what was supposed to be a brief trip. His crime was that he tweeted critically about the Saudi regime while in the United States.\nThis also happens to people in countries that are popular tourist destinations. People have been given 25-year prison sentences in Thailand for posting pictures online that are deemed insulting to the country’s monarchy. Ahmed Monsoor was sentenced to prison for a decade for advocating for human rights in the UAE in a way that was critical of the rulers. As Human Rights Watch reported:\nAt his third hearing, the judge read out six charges against Mansoor, all entirely based on his human rights activism and advocacy. The court later convicted him of five of those charges, all based on simple acts of human rights advocacy, including tweeting about injustices, participating in international human rights conferences online, and (since deleted) email exchanges and WhatsApp conversations with representatives of human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR). The court acquitted him of the sixth charge, “cooperating with a terrorist organization.”\nThe court based its verdict, announced during the fifth and final hearing, on the penal code and the 2012 cybercrimes law, both of which make the peaceful expression of critical views of the authorities, senior officials, the judiciary, and even public policy a criminal offense and provide a legal basis to prosecute and jail people who argue for political reform or organize unlicensed demonstrations.\nOver 1.4 billion people have information suppressed in China and are subject to varying levels of authoritarianism. India, another country of 1.4 billion people is much less restrictive, but still gets information removed from social media and has a mixed human rights track record. Hundreds of millions of people across parts of the Middle East and parts of southeast Asia are subject to authoritarian rule. Vladimir Putin’s political opposition, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned, and upon surviving and returning to Russia, was put in prison and remains there until this day. A subset of Latin American countries and African countries have authoritarian rule. It’s an extremely widespread problem. Meanwhile, institutions that are largely run by developed countries, such as the IMF, gladly work with authoritarian regimes, which can help keep them in power.\nOne of the defenses that people have against authoritarianism is private, encrypted communication and information. This allows for the transfer of information and value, including in private ways. Technologies such as this will rarely be provided in a top-down way; instead if they are to exist and be resilient, they must be built in a bottom-up and highly distributed way.\nAlong the way, such technologies will be painted as tools of drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and terrorists by those who are in power. And what will complicate matters is that yes, just like pagers, just like the internet, and just like any powerful technology or network, criminals will be among those that use such tools. And yet, those tools are necessary, and can help far more people than they can hurt.\nThe Long Debate\nAuthoritarian regimes have often turned to obvious anti-privacy techniques in order to prevent revolutions. Such regimes want to control the spread of information as much as possible.\nIn Western democracies, anti-privacy crackdowns have instead been more gradual, and have generally existed on the institutional level rather than the consumer level. It’s easier to get several thousand highly-regulated banks and a few dozen major internet platforms and telecommunication companies to comply with continuous financial and information surveillance than it is to get hundreds of millions of individuals to do so.\nWe generally have a rolling set of reasons for why privacy needs to be violated in such a continuous, systemic, and automated way. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, it was often argued that financial and information privacy must be restricted in order to restrain drug trafficking. Back in the 1980s, for example, pagers were a source of consternation:\nAlthough paging devices, or beepers, have grown in popularity throughout the labor force — doctors, delivery people and journalists often use them — they also have become a staple in the drug business, posing fresh problems for law enforcement and threatening to tarnish the image of a booming high-tech industry.\n-Washington Post, 1988, “Message is Out on Beepers“\nStarting in the 2000s, it was terrorism financing that took center stage instead. The 2001 Patriot Act, among other things, expanded surveillance capabilities by the U.S. government in the name of fighting terrorism. The NSA’s programs in the 2010s, revealed by Snowden, further expanded and automated that capability by connecting with major internet messaging platforms and aggregating as much online communication as possible.\nMore recently, the public messaging around restrictions on privacy have been about child imagery and/or sanctioned nation states. Throughout 2022, the European Commission proposed legislation that would try to eliminate all private communications by mandating the automatic scanning of emails and messages, including encrypted messages, for certain types of illegal content. While everyone is of course against the existence and distribution of such dreadful imagery, the idea that every communication method of all citizens must be continuously scanned and made accessible to the government is argued by many to be an extreme overreach. Similarly, the U.S. Treasury sanctioning of Tornado Cash was a crackdown on cryptographic privacy methods due to its association with DeFi hacks, including by North Korea. Any entity that handles funds on a commercial scale has do various identity checks, and so various centralized private custodians tend to be regularly shut down. In the modern era, unlike the past, financial privacy is considered to be synonymous with money laundering.\nAnother problem relates to tax collection. Back in older times when transactions were more inherently private, something like an income tax was relatively unworkable. Taxes tended to be placed on property and on exports/imports, and on income for large establishments or estates, because all of that was quite visible and auditable. In contrast, taxing income at the individual level was generally a messy proposition due to the difficulty and expense of auditing it. Even today, accurately taxing cash-dominated businesses remains a challenge.\nHowever, with the widespread conversion towards bank ledgers and automatic employer paychecks, it became easier for governments to audit incomes and to tax them. Employers pay their employees, report the payouts to the government, and the whole process is auditable. Income taxes thus became a dominant form of taxation.\nGoing forward, if a meaningful portion of the economy shifts towards peer-to-peer global gig work, and money and information in general become more encrypted and private, and money is able to be self-custodied and moved around globally, then what does that mean for governments’ ability to audit incomes and impose taxation on those incomes at the individual level? Such auditing and assessment could become much more expensive, and for sophisticated users, potentially becomes impossible.\nOne perspective would be that governments simply have to change their patterns of taxation over time, if indeed bottom-up open-source distributed privacy technology and open monetary/information networks become more widespread. In some sense, this would be a return to how things used to be, except in the digital realm. A greater portion of taxation would have to be on more physical, large, and visible things, such as property, major enterprise, and the logistics and sale points of physical products.\nThe other perspective, generally from the viewpoint of government, is that instead all privacy has to be eliminated, then. Every transaction between every peer, globally, has to be monitorable so that it can be audited and taxed. Even if an open-source bottom-up emergent technology is developed to enable privacy, such technology must be outlawed and/or marginalized as much as possible to prevent its widespread use. It may even be necessary to place more restrictions on the developers of such technology, as the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act essentially proposed.\nUnfortunately, this second perspective takes on a very different meaning when we remember that billions of people live under authoritarianism, and that people can readily be arrested and sentenced to long prison terms for criticizing their government, organizing protests, having the wrong sexual orientation, having the wrong religion, or otherwise having some minority or disapproved aspect of their life.\nOver the long run, I view the outcome, one way or the other, more as a matter of technology than politics. From the top-down side there is the development of Big Data and automated data-surveillance capabilities. From the bottom-up side there is the development of encryption tools and open monetary/information networks. Whichever direction proves more powerful will play a major role in how all sorts of things operate in the decades ahead, including various economic interactions.\nTherefore, for proponents of privacy and open networks to win becomes a matter of making the technology easy to use, too costly to stamp out, and well understood by the public. For proponents of ubiquitous surveillance to win becomes a matter of convincing the public that privacy is undesirable and that these tools are not needed or are dangerous, while enhancing their data collection and sorting capabilities.\nAnd from an analyst perspective, the challenge and the opportunity is to see where these trends are headed, which means monitoring the progress of both the bottom-up an the top-down approaches to see who is in the lead.\n"],["length","47737"],["r","https://zapworthy.com/load?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynalden.com%2Fopen-networks%2F&author=npub1a2cww4kn9wqte4ry70vyfwqyqvpswksna27rtxd8vty6c74era8sdcw83a"],["published_at","1681943220"]]}]"###)

There have been many, many, many requests for this functionality. The recent addition of the rescan feature will help. When you import the key, do a rescan to pick up the transaction that funds it. Then pay yourself. People want this for backups too.\n\nI don't think you need to remove the key from the sender's wallet, it will still notice when it's spent. OTOH might be a good idea to remove it, otherwise you might accidentally spend it before the recipient inputs it.\n\n162\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Re: How will the merkel hash tree be stored?](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3414.msg48309#msg48309)\n\non: February 13, 2011, 07:33:12 PM\n\nI agree that Satoshi's \"200 bytes for backward compatibility\" is something of a mystery. The 200 is probably a clue. It is quite a bit bigger than a Bitcoin block header. Might be about the size of a block header plus a dummy transaction.\n\nThere are still some ways to embed arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions. AFAIK scriptSig data is not checked, and you could put anything at the front without invalidating any signatures. So a BitDNS hash could be stuck into the current Bitcoin block.\n\n163\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Re: How will the merkel hash tree be stored?](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3414.msg48084#msg48084)\n\non: February 13, 2011, 04:33:31 AM\n\nThe idea of a Merkle tree is you just store the root, and then when someone wants to convince you that something's in the tree, they produce the Merkle branch. The Merkle roots are in the block headers. Merkle branches are stored with transactions in wallets. So when you do a spend, in principle you can prove that your \"in\" transactions are legit, by providing the Merkle branches for all of them. However there are no data structures defined at this time for sending such information in the network.\n\nNow this is not a matter of removing spent transactions; rather, it's a mode of operation that would allow nodes to forget all transactions, spent and unspent, and just keep block headers.\n\n167\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Bitcoin Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0) / [Re: Core ideas of Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3336.msg46899#msg46899)\n\non: February 11, 2011, 12:46:28 AM\n\nI would focus on two ideas:How are bitcoins created?Everyone on the network competes to be the first solve a computationally hard puzzle. The winner is rewarded with 50 new bitcoins. Puzzle difficulty is automatically adjusted so it takes about ten minutes to get a solution, creating a slow, manageable increase in the supply of bitcoins. The 50 bitcoin reward gets halved every four years, so the total number of bitcoins that will ever be created stays under 21 million.How are bitcoins transferred?Bitcoins are associated with cryptographic public keys controlled by the person who owns them. To transfer them to someone else (i.e. to make a payment) he broadcasts on the Bitcoin network a digital signature identifying the bitcoins he is transferring, along with the public key of the new owner. This information is stored in a distributed database maintained by the Bitcoin network that records the public keys that own every bitcoin. Bitcoin software validates the digital signature and updates the database to record the new owner of the bitcoins. He will then be able to transfer them to someone else in the future.Note that I am not trying to explain how these two ideas are connected, via the block chain. That's just too hard to get across quickly.\n\n168\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Re: Network-wide cost of a transaction](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3332.msg46876#msg46876)\n\non: February 10, 2011, 11:31:02 PM\n\nVerifying an ECDSA signature takes about 3 ms. Let's say the typical transaction has 2 inputs. Each transaction is verified twice, once alone and once in a block. That's 12 ms per node, times 10000 nodes for 120 cpu-seconds, aka 2 cpu-minutes or 1/30 cpu-hour. I'm going to say a computer draws 300W @ $0.10/kWh for electricity, for $0.03 per cpu-hour. YMMV. That makes $0.001 for cpu costs, a tenth of a cent, which appears to dominate.\n\n169\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Re: More divisibility required - move the decimal point](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3311.msg46756#msg46756)\n\non: February 10, 2011, 06:53:14 PM\n\nLots of good ideas here!\n\nI like Gavin's idea to display full precision in the UI and allow it on payments.\n\nI like ribuck's terminology: 100 bitcents in a bitcoin, 1000 millicents in a bitcent, 1000 microcents in a Millicent.\n\nI like \\[mike\\]'s suggestion to allow miners to store information relating to costs and policies, and to adapt network behavior from that information. I'd suggest using it specifically to normalize the \"anti-spam\" limits: the 0.01 minimums for large-transaction fees and for free transactions. Clearly Bitcoin needs a way to adjust these values, and Mike's proposal seems like a good candidate.\n\nI also wonder if the anti-spam rule shouldn't be changed, to trigger if the largest output is tiny, rather than for any output. In Gavin's example, outputs of 1.5 and 0.000001 change seem ok to me.\n\n171\n\n [Economy](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#3) / [Economics](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0) / [Re: Bitcoin value](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3293.msg46396#msg46396)\n\non: February 10, 2011, 05:10:30 AM\n\nIMO one way to get a handle on a reasonable value for 1 bitcoin is via this formula:\n\nprobability Bitcoin ultimately succeeds \\* value of 1 bitcoin if it succeeds\n\nBitcoin has the potential to become the dominant currency for large-scale electronic transactions worldwide.

Next is the bitcoin amount, your address that received the bitcoins, and the date of the transaction. Finally come the optional words change and spent. Change means this transaction produced change as a side effect of a payment you made to others, and the address shown is the change address, which is largely hidden in the client UI. Spent means that the bitcoin(s) associated with this transaction have been spent and are no longer available.\n\nThere are basically three types of wallet transactions. First are payments from someone else to a wallet key. Next are payments to others which happen to exactly use up one or more available transactions, with nothing left over. These are shown as \"payment\" in the address field and are always marked as spent. Last are payments where there were bitcoins left over, which get returned to a new address. These are the ones which are shown as change.\n\nTo see the transactions which are available for spending, filter out the spent ones with grep -v:\n\n./bc\\_key EVERYTHING ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat | grep ^tx | grep -v spent\\\\$\n\ntx cff5962c80af06506d6583710fdbde01b95e0bf4a37df27af82ee5038b241016    9.00000000 1NiihskVid2GTWEJjKDaft67aFkeCJTTaE 2011/02/06 change  \ntx 31989da39c18a351fb393b05d7d66efd69cf1cc64958d67a5c49189e28402b1f    0.50000000 157a7eFdnTg89gPZ5wWPjX1TMVL3ffeDSh 2011/01/28 change  \ntx 78537330713ec5c92befd3e1a91c754198ee14877c02d8888c899280d0a49c58  994.00000000 1K8THF4Qkr5mMKjQRJe1xW33ZYoUrgtUHL 2011/01/20 change  \ntx 03f87b3c1ed4231e64a781ce2f8c10c03e7a3f6439389c97af640e1e63eb29b0    0.25000000 1LKRbsyxiSi3zfHKyumEH8W7fSQapapnnw 2011/01/28 change  \ntx 230fec2b39bc56ef359a5c078505b8aac0d8221c5109dd0fa8f98ddd667ab8d3   18.87000000 12BxP2C6aj2KT5fsnNdiyVMKfhm9tu1MK4 2011/02/01  \n\nThese are really my \"bitcoins\". They are what I have available to spend. The sum of the bitcoin amounts should equal my wallet balance. Any spend I make will come from one or more of these transactions. Generally, the Bitcoin client will try to combine one or more small transactions to make a payment, otherwise it will use the smallest single transaction capable of funding the payment.\n\nAlthough my wallet doesn't show it too clearly, it's not unusual for a single Bitcoin address to be funded by multiple transactions. But for making payments, this is basically irrelevant. Individual transactions are picked to fund payments without regard to whether some of them happen to use the same address.\n\n174\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Re: Sppliting/merging wallets](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=751.msg46109#msg46109)\n\non: February 09, 2011, 06:16:50 PM\n\nPeople talk about moving keys/addresses, but also it is important to move the transactions. Bitcoin is a transaction based system. Your keys authorize (sign) payments, but the payments actually come from the transactions you have received and which are in your wallet. If you're splitting off some keys into another wallet, you need to move the transactions that fund those keys, or they won't be able to do anything. (Should move address book and account entries too.)\n\n175\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Re: Speeding up signature verification](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3238.msg45795#msg45795)\n\non: February 08, 2011, 09:08:58 PM\n\nI've put the code up at github.

I own the book but I also found a PDF on a Russian site which is more convenient.\n\nsecp256k1 uses the following prime for its x and y coordinates:\n\np = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2f\n\nand the curve order is:\n\nn = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141\n\nThe first step is to compute values beta, lambda such that for any curve point Q = (x,y):\n\nlambda \\* Q = (beta\\*x mod p, y)\n\nThis is the so-called efficiently computable endomorphism, and what it means is, you can multiply any curve point by this special value lambda very quickly, by doing a single mod-p multiply.\n\nThe book tells (well, hints) how to compute lambda and beta, and here are the values I found:\n\nlambda = 0x5363ad4cc05c30e0a5261c028812645a122e22ea20816678df02967c1b23bd72\n\nbeta = 0x7ae96a2b657c07106e64479eac3434e99cf0497512f58995c1396c28719501ee\n\nGiven that we can multiply by lambda quickly, here is the trick to compute k\\*Q. First use the shortcut to compute Q' = lambda\\*Q. Next, k must be decomposed into two parts k1 and k2, each about half the width of n, such that:\n\nk = k1 + k2\\*lambda mod n\n\nThen\n\nk\\*Q = (k1 + k2\\*lambda)\\*Q = k1\\*Q + k2\\*lambda\\*Q = k1\\*Q + k2\\*Q'\n\nThat last expression can be evaluated efficiently via a double multiply algorithm, and since k1 and k2 are half length, we get the speedup.\n\nThe missing piece is splitting k into k1 and k2. This uses the following 4 values:\n\na1 = 0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15  \nb1 = -0xe4437ed6010e88286f547fa90abfe4c3  \na2 = 0x114ca50f7a8e2f3f657c1108d9d44cfd8  \nb2 = 0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15\n\n(it's ok that a1 = b2)\n\nUse these as follows to split k:\n\nc1 = RoundToNearestInteger(b2\\*k/n)  \nc2 = RoundToNearestInteger(-b1\\*k/n)\n\nk1 = k - c1\\*a1 - c2\\*a2  \nk2 = -c1\\*b1 - c2\\*b2\n\nWith all this, I measure about a 25% speedup on raw signature verifications. For Bitcoin, initial block load from a wifi-connected local node is reduced from:\n\nreal   36m21.537s  \nuser   24m43.277s  \nsys   0m27.950s\n\nto:\n\nreal   32m59.777s  \nuser   18m21.145s  \nsys   0m28.262s\n\nNot a big difference, and it would probably be even less significant when fetching over the net.\n\n177\n\n [Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#1) / [Development & Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) / [Speeding up signature verification](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3238.msg45461#msg45461)\n\non: February 07, 2011, 10:31:27 PM\n\nIn another thread, \\[mike\\] wrote:\n\nI'm trying to inplement the secp256k1 shortcut. Should have results shortly. Unfortunately I only expect about 20% speedup. We'll see.\n\nI'm also looking at batch signature verification:\n\n[http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/batch.pdf](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/batch.pdf)\n\n[http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/publications/2007/BatchVer\\_PKC2007\\_CL.pdf](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/publications/2007/BatchVer_PKC2007_CL.pdf)\n\nThis can theoretically speed up verification by almost a factor of 4 (table 6 in 2nd paper) if you have a lot of signatures in a batch. It requires a slight change in the ECDSA signature format: (r, s) is replaced by (R, s), where R is the EC point of which r is the x coordinate. This change could be applied retroactively, as R is calculated and discarded every time the sig is verified.\n\nWe do tend to have sigs in batches, namely blocks; sometimes several dozen or even hundreds, and this will grow. Batch verification returns true iff all sigs are valid. A good block should never have invalid signatures so it makes sense to batch the verify.\n\nI need to research some security aspects, namely: does R need to be checked to see if it's on the curve (ie y^2 = x^3 + 7)? And what is an appropriate security parameter for the probability the batch verify test could be fooled? The papers talk about 2^80 but that seems too conservative.\n\n180\n\n [Other](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php#4) / [Meta](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0) / [Re: Improving the Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3214.msg45121#msg45121)\n\non: February 06, 2011, 06:31:54 PM\n\nI'd like to see a separate forum for mining.

The 200 is probably a clue. It is quite a bit bigger than a Bitcoin block header. Might be about the size of a block header plus a dummy transaction.There are still some ways to embed arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions. AFAIK scriptSig data is not checked, and you could put anything at the front without invalidating any signatures.

The Merkle roots are in the block headers. Merkle branches are stored with transactions in wallets. So when you do a spend, in principle you can prove that your \"in\" transactions are legit, by providing the Merkle branches for all of them. However there are no data structures defined at this time for sending such information in the network.Now this is not a matter of removing spent transactions; rather, it's a mode of operation that would allow nodes to forget all transactions, spent and unspent, and just keep block headers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t167\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bitcoin / Bitcoin Discussion / Re: Core ideas of Bitcoin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton: February 11, 2011, 12:46:28 AM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI would focus on two ideas:How are bitcoins created?Everyone on the network competes to be the first solve a computationally hard puzzle. The winner is rewarded with 50 new bitcoins. Puzzle difficulty is automatically adjusted so it takes about ten minutes to get a solution, creating a slow, manageable increase in the supply of bitcoins. The 50 bitcoin reward gets halved every four years, so the total number of bitcoins that will ever be created stays under 21 million.How are bitcoins transferred?Bitcoins are associated with cryptographic public keys controlled by the person who owns them. To transfer them to someone else (i.e. to make a payment) he broadcasts on the Bitcoin network a digital signature identifying the bitcoins he is transferring, along with the public key of the new owner. This information is stored in a distributed database maintained by the Bitcoin network that records the public keys that own every bitcoin. Bitcoin software validates the digital signature and updates the database to record the new owner of the bitcoins. He will then be able to transfer them to someone else in the future.Note that I am not trying to explain how these two ideas are connected, via the block chain. That's just too hard to get across quickly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t168\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bitcoin / Development & Technical Discussion / Re: Network-wide cost of a transaction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton: February 10, 2011, 11:31:02 PM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVerifying an ECDSA signature takes about 3 ms.

I'd suggest using it specifically to normalize the \"anti-spam\" limits: the 0.01 minimums for large-transaction fees and for free transactions. Clearly Bitcoin needs a way to adjust these values, and Mike's proposal seems like a good candidate.I also wonder if the anti-spam rule shouldn't be changed, to trigger if the largest output is tiny, rather than for any output.

Next is the bitcoin amount, your address that received the bitcoins, and the date of the transaction. Finally come the optional words change and spent. Change means this transaction produced change as a side effect of a payment you made to others, and the address shown is the change address, which is largely hidden in the client UI. Spent means that the bitcoin(s) associated with this transaction have been spent and are no longer available.There are basically three types of wallet transactions. First are payments from someone else to a wallet key. Next are payments to others which happen to exactly use up one or more available transactions, with nothing left over. These are shown as \"payment\" in the address field and are always marked as spent. Last are payments where there were bitcoins left over, which get returned to a new address. These are the ones which are shown as change.To see the transactions which are available for spending, filter out the spent ones with grep -v:./bc_key EVERYTHING ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat | grep ^tx | grep -v spent\\$tx cff5962c80af06506d6583710fdbde01b95e0bf4a37df27af82ee5038b241016    9.00000000 1NiihskVid2GTWEJjKDaft67aFkeCJTTaE 2011/02/06 changetx 31989da39c18a351fb393b05d7d66efd69cf1cc64958d67a5c49189e28402b1f    0.50000000 157a7eFdnTg89gPZ5wWPjX1TMVL3ffeDSh 2011/01/28 changetx 78537330713ec5c92befd3e1a91c754198ee14877c02d8888c899280d0a49c58  994.00000000 1K8THF4Qkr5mMKjQRJe1xW33ZYoUrgtUHL 2011/01/20 changetx 03f87b3c1ed4231e64a781ce2f8c10c03e7a3f6439389c97af640e1e63eb29b0    0.25000000 1LKRbsyxiSi3zfHKyumEH8W7fSQapapnnw 2011/01/28 changetx 230fec2b39bc56ef359a5c078505b8aac0d8221c5109dd0fa8f98ddd667ab8d3   18.87000000 12BxP2C6aj2KT5fsnNdiyVMKfhm9tu1MK4 2011/02/01These are really my \"bitcoins\". They are what I have available to spend. The sum of the bitcoin amounts should equal my wallet balance. Any spend I make will come from one or more of these transactions. Generally, the Bitcoin client will try to combine one or more small transactions to make a payment, otherwise it will use the smallest single transaction capable of funding the payment.Although my wallet doesn't show it too clearly, it's not unusual for a single Bitcoin address to be funded by multiple transactions. But for making payments, this is basically irrelevant. Individual transactions are picked to fund payments without regard to whether some of them happen to use the same address.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t174\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bitcoin / Development & Technical Discussion / Re: Sppliting/merging wallets\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton: February 09, 2011, 06:16:50 PM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeople talk about moving keys/addresses, but also it is important to move the transactions. Bitcoin is a transaction based system. Your keys authorize (sign) payments, but the payments actually come from the transactions you have received and which are in your wallet. If you're splitting off some keys into another wallet, you need to move the transactions that fund those keys, or they won't be able to do anything. (Should move address book and account entries too.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t175\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bitcoin / Development & Technical Discussion / Re: Speeding up signature verification\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton: February 08, 2011, 09:08:58 PM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI've put the code up at github.

I own the book but I also found a PDF on a Russian site which is more convenient.secp256k1 uses the following prime for its x and y coordinates:p = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2fand the curve order is:n = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141The first step is to compute values beta, lambda such that for any curve point Q = (x,y):lambda * Q = (beta*x mod p, y)This is the so-called efficiently computable endomorphism, and what it means is, you can multiply any curve point by this special value lambda very quickly, by doing a single mod-p multiply.The book tells (well, hints) how to compute lambda and beta, and here are the values I found:lambda = 0x5363ad4cc05c30e0a5261c028812645a122e22ea20816678df02967c1b23bd72beta = 0x7ae96a2b657c07106e64479eac3434e99cf0497512f58995c1396c28719501eeGiven that we can multiply by lambda quickly, here is the trick to compute k*Q. First use the shortcut to compute Q' = lambda*Q. Next, k must be decomposed into two parts k1 and k2, each about half the width of n, such that:k = k1 + k2*lambda mod nThenk*Q = (k1 + k2*lambda)*Q = k1*Q + k2*lambda*Q = k1*Q + k2*Q'That last expression can be evaluated efficiently via a double multiply algorithm, and since k1 and k2 are half length, we get the speedup.The missing piece is splitting k into k1 and k2. This uses the following 4 values:a1 = 0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15b1 = -0xe4437ed6010e88286f547fa90abfe4c3a2 = 0x114ca50f7a8e2f3f657c1108d9d44cfd8b2 = 0x3086d221a7d46bcde86c90e49284eb15(it's ok that a1 = b2)Use these as follows to split k:c1 = RoundToNearestInteger(b2*k/n)c2 = RoundToNearestInteger(-b1*k/n)k1 = k - c1*a1 - c2*a2k2 = -c1*b1 - c2*b2With all this, I measure about a 25% speedup on raw signature verifications. For Bitcoin, initial block load from a wifi-connected local node is reduced from:real   36m21.537suser   24m43.277ssys   0m27.950sto:real   32m59.777suser   18m21.145ssys   0m28.262sNot a big difference, and it would probably be even less significant when fetching over the net.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t177\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bitcoin / Development & Technical Discussion / Speeding up signature verification\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton: February 07, 2011, 10:31:27 PM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn another thread, [mike] wrote:I'm trying to inplement the secp256k1 shortcut. Should have results shortly. Unfortunately I only expect about 20% speedup. We'll see.I'm also looking at batch signature verification:http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/batch.pdfhttp://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/publications/2007/BatchVer_PKC2007_CL.pdfThis can theoretically speed up verification by almost a factor of 4 (table 6 in 2nd paper) if you have a lot of signatures in a batch. It requires a slight change in the ECDSA signature format: (r, s) is replaced by (R, s), where R is the EC point of which r is the x coordinate. This change could be applied retroactively, as R is calculated and discarded every time the sig is verified.We do tend to have sigs in batches, namely blocks; sometimes several dozen or even hundreds, and this will grow. Batch verification returns true iff all sigs are valid. A good block should never have invalid signatures so it makes sense to batch the verify.I need to research some security aspects, namely: does R need to be checked to see if it's on the curve (ie y^2 = x^3 + 7)? And what is an appropriate security parameter for the probability the batch verify test could be fooled? The papers talk about 2^80 but that seems too conservative.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t180\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Other / Meta / Re: Improving the Bitcoin Forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton: February 06, 2011, 06:31:54 PM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'd like to see a separate forum for mining.

The winner is rewarded with 50 new bitcoins. Puzzle difficulty is automatically adjusted so it takes about ten minutes to get a solution, creating a slow, manageable increase in the supply of bitcoins. The 50 bitcoin reward gets halved every four years, so the total number of bitcoins that will ever be created stays under 21 million.How are bitcoins transferred?Bitcoins are associated with cryptographic public keys controlled by the person who owns them. To transfer them to someone else (i.e. to make a payment) he broadcasts on the Bitcoin network a digital signature identifying the bitcoins he is transferring, along with the public key of the new owner. This information is stored in a distributed database maintained by the Bitcoin network that records the public keys that own every bitcoin. Bitcoin software validates the digital signature and updates the database to record the new owner of the bitcoins. He will then be able to transfer them to someone else in the future.Note that I am not trying to explain how these two ideas are connected, via the block chain. That's just too hard to get across quickly.","created_at":1681931331,"id":"0e9f993ed65bb1a5a136771bd8773ecfab5f621804b54f019bc213ca1d756099","kind":9802,"pubkey":"50de492cfe5472450df1a0176fdf6d915e97cb5d9f8d3eccef7d25ff0a8871de","sig":"1bbfe4135b9b1e866875d89315c4caeeb7d872f3ca33348490dca3481c2944083a34603bfca30b5d5c04dc3235eea3c07e888f9a74269977460ecd19e051b5bc","tags":[["r","https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2436;sa=showPosts;start=160"]]}]"###)

Thanks for reading!**\n\nA couple of years ago, NFTs were becoming all the rage and as a tech guy for over 25 years I was curious to learn how these massive collections were being created so quickly. After reading a few “How To” articles, I decided to give it a go and created my own goofy wine themed collection called [the Wine Buddies](https://winebuddies.io/) for the fun of it. A few of my online friends thought I should make them available for sale and see what would happen.\n\nI [posted a thorough article about my process](https://www.sonofvin.com/2021/11/14/introducing-the-wine-buddies-my-first-generative-nft-art-collection/) and the eventual steps of putting them up online on OpenSea, an NFT marketplace. Ultimately I was doing this as a learning experience. Though everyone dreams of something going wildly successful, I was happy that I had accomplished my original goal, learning something new.\n\nJust a small side note before we move on: I’ve worked as a software engineer with paying customers since 1996 and have seen so many technologies and computer languages come and go over the years. There have been plenty of them claiming to be game changers and the next popular thing all coders must learn in order to stay relevant and employable. It can get rather draining and tedious to learn new techniques and discard old bad habits every few years. Some of it is relatable to what you’ve learned before, though every so often something is so new and unique it takes much more focus to truly understand. The worst is when these new trending techs never reach their true potential and can make you feel like you’ve wasted too much time on something that will no longer be used. It’s a risk we all have to take though, as our options are either 1) not try to learn these new things and risk eventually becoming obsolete or 2) spend too much time on something that fades away and then you also risk becoming obsolete.\n\nWhen I was young, single, and full of curiosity, it was certainly much easier to keep up with all of this. Now that I am older, a dad, and with much less time on my hands, I simply can’t keep up with it nor do I want to. The rate of new technologies coming out is now even much faster than before, so it’s damn near impossible to truly keep up with everything anyway. Which means we risk even more by choosing or not choosing. With the launch of AIs like ChatGPT and Bard, I think things have just advanced to a new level, maybe even a different game entirely. New jobs and industries were created overnight for AI content writers, artists, and more.\n\nSo, anyway, after I launched my [Wine Buddies NFT collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/wine-buddies), I created a Twitter account specifically for the collection as it was by far the biggest used platform for NFT collectors and was surprised at the reception I was receiving. Due to this initial buzz, I even had them ranked on [Rarity Sniper](https://raritysniper.com/wine-buddies), a popular website for NFT collectors, to see which of the Wine Buddies were the most unique. All of this fell in line with what everyone else was doing with their collections, so I figured “why not”. Not too long after this my calendar was quickly being filled up as I was being invited to speak on Twitter Spaces about my collection both to the wine and NFT communities.\n\n![Nostr and wine](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-wine-2.jpg)  \nThen suddenly, one day Wine Buddies’ Twitter account was suspended without any explanation and all of those Spaces I was supposed to attend were now unreachable. All I ever posted about was wine and the Wine Buddies NFT collection itself. No politics, hate, etc. As a web developer, I knew they had an API for us to test and work with in order to help automate our activities. As a one man team, this made me curious what they offered and how it could help me. I had worked with it in the past for clients, but it had been a while. I had spent one morning testing out their API and what their documentation showed we could do with it. Only a few hours later my account was suspended. My best guess was that something (that their own documentation explained how to do!) triggered this suspension. I never received a response from Twitter support as to why. Appeals went unanswered. No phone number to call, their own support account would never respond to direct messages. Months went by and my NFT project lost all of its momentum and over time NFTs in general lost their buzz.\n\nI never once received any emails from Twitter directly. Almost a year after this, I tried logging into that account and noticed bolded text saying it was now Permanently Suspended with just a link to their Terms of Service. Something on there TOS was what I had apparently broke and it was up to me to figure out exactly what.\n\nThe entire ordeal made me disheartened more than I had expected. This went from something I was doing for fun, to _Wow, this is really taking off_, to frustration, and ultimately sadness. It was all entirely out of my control and I should have known better. Social media companies are all businesses and ultimately they get to choose who uses them and they don’t have to explain why either. _Free speech_ is not covered once you start using their business. We’re just the product (our data) that they sell to their advertisers. One tiny ant is meaningless to the greater hive mind. They also get to choose what content we see and who your own posts get to be seen by. Try creating a new account on many of those platforms now. It’s extremely hard to get seen by anyone unless you are already famous.\n\nIt really made me not want to use their service anymore (and frankly most of social media) and I nearly stopped using my main account afterwards. Still to this day, the Wine Buddies NFT account is permanently suspended. A few years before this incident, my personal Facebook account was also suspended for no reason. I rarely commented on anything and mostly just posted family pictures on my own timeline. I appealed and did eventually get that account back but never once received a reason why it even happened.\n\nAfter my WineBuddies NFT Twitter incident, I finally started looking into decentralized social media platforms. Decentralization in a nutshell means that no one person or organization has full control. Ultimately all of the individuals involved have a say in things. It’s true that a huge mass of people could band together to move the flow a certain way, but it still couldn’t be fully controlled. Decentralization has been slowly gaining attention across all multimedia platforms (video, social media, etc) but it wasn’t until Elon Musk bought Twitter that decentralized platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) were suddenly gaining broader media attention due to the growing concern of censorship. Then late last year, former Twitter CEO and current Block CEO Jack Dorsey catapulted Nostr’s media attention by announcing a major donation to help push development forward faster.\n\n![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-and-Wine.jpg)  \nI did setup a Mastodon site for my [film and music industry individuals](https://filmmusic.social/) to communicate, but I have personally landed on Nostr as my preferred decentralized censorship-free social media platform. Like Mastodon, Nostr uses relays to spread data around. Nostr which stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” has a purple ostrich as its mascot and is still heavy on the technical side to use, but so was the early days of the Internet. Users are often dubbed Nostriches, and posts are filled with jokes and memes no different than most other social media platforms, yet there is heavy tech talk focusing on building out the platform every week.\n\nThe way it is built, anyone can setup a website that lets users interact within the protocol. There is an ever growing list of dozens of web clients and other [projects here](https://www.nostr.net/).\n\nOne of its major differences from Mastodon, is that while Mastodon still requires email addresses and passwords to login, Nostr uses generated private and public keys for every user. So you don’t need to have an email address, you just need to keep your keys safe. There are some drawbacks to this idea though. Like if you lose your private key, you’re out of luck. No one can get it back for you. Or if someone gains access to where you are storing it and starts using it, then your account is compromised and you will need to create a new one. The positive to using generated keys is that it can be as anonymous as you wish and is entirely self controlled considering even your e-mail address or domain name providers can block your usage.\n\nAnyone can setup a relay if they are technically inclined enough, and they can allow anyone to post or read data from their relays. Ultimately your social global feed is an accumulation of posts from all of the relays you are attaching to. You can also follow people just like on other platforms and then just see a feed of their posts the same way. No one can be outright banned or suspended, but each user can choose to block someone they don’t want to see.\n\nThe largest advantage to Nostr I see right now is that you can get paid in Sats (short for Satoshis, the smaller unit of a full Bitcoin) by other users. Post something funny or inspiring? Expect to get “zapped” (slang for receiving Sats). Just this week, someone who is pretty well liked on Nostr posted that they were having a bad week financially and needed some money to help their situation. Within a short time, they were sent enough Sats to help out. I’m sure they will return the favor when time allows it.\n\n![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-Wine-300x300.jpg)  \nThere’s even a pretty big growing group of wine lovers on Nostr made up of winemakers, industry professionals, and superfans like myself. We love to talk about what we’re drinking, give tips to others, start #winechain chains, and even drool over winery pictures from winemaker Ben Justman at [Peony Lane Wine](https://www.peonylanewine.com/) out of Colorado. He plans to release a special Bitcoin theme run of wines in the near future. Hopefully I’ll be able to include them in my next [Bitcoin and wine related article](https://www.sonofvin.com/2021/06/20/bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-and-the-future-of-wine/). One of the largest and best paid relays currently available is even named after wine, [Nostr.wine](https://nostr-wine.github.io/filter-relay/).\n\nWith Nostr’s ability to create direct messages, private channels, and even relays that theoretically only members of a private businesses could use to share internal messages between users, this could serve any industry looking for a free communication platform to conduct business without breaking the bank on monthly fees. Payment invoices can be directly handled from the Lightning Network, an integral part of the fast growing Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-wine-3.jpg)  \nNostr, as a protocol, has a much broader and brighter future as ideas continue to be fleshed out weekly. It’s truly marvelous to watch how far it has come in just a few short months. Considering there wasn’t even a public iOS app for it until a month or so ago. Its developers are all working independently, solving bounties on an open source project, and are coming together to put an end to controlled and centralized platforms.\n\nSome savvy software engineers have already setup bots that play chess with you or offer hourly lottery drawings. Some bots merely zap people randomly every few minutes after they’ve made new posts. I’m even currently building a bot to zap people myself!\n\nRight now, using Nostr can be a bit tricky for those not very technically inclined. Hopefully a solution will be created soon to make it a bit easier for people to switch over. Everyone I know so far that has tried it is amazed and loves the freedom it gives. Most of the users are very welcoming and love debating tough topics with each other. And if you don’t like someone? Block them!\n\nI’ve been around the Internet since its early days and haven’t seen such a major shift like this since those first sets of online chatrooms were being created. Which funny enough, I had a major part in. As a teenager, I created one of the earliest and most successful Internet based chatroom systems with thousands of rooms used around the globe. But it was ultimately centralized and I watched as the person I built it for slowly destroyed it so I had to move on.\n\nI’m glad to see something new get created that won’t have that problem. It’s highly possible that as more people are able to join the Nostr community, the word will spread and people will wonder why they ever dealt with the way these companies had been treating them all along.\n\n_I wrote this while having a nice tall glass of Syrah.

Thanks for reading!\nA couple of years ago, NFTs were becoming all the rage and as a tech guy for over 25 years I was curious to learn how these massive collections were being created so quickly. After reading a few “How To” articles, I decided to give it a go and created my own goofy wine themed collection called the Wine Buddies for the fun of it. A few of my online friends thought I should make them available for sale and see what would happen.\nI posted a thorough article about my process and the eventual steps of putting them up online on OpenSea, an NFT marketplace. Ultimately I was doing this as a learning experience. Though everyone dreams of something going wildly successful, I was happy that I had accomplished my original goal, learning something new.\nJust a small side note before we move on: I’ve worked as a software engineer with paying customers since 1996 and have seen so many technologies and computer languages come and go over the years. There have been plenty of them claiming to be game changers and the next popular thing all coders must learn in order to stay relevant and employable. It can get rather draining and tedious to learn new techniques and discard old bad habits every few years. Some of it is relatable to what you’ve learned before, though every so often something is so new and unique it takes much more focus to truly understand. The worst is when these new trending techs never reach their true potential and can make you feel like you’ve wasted too much time on something that will no longer be used. It’s a risk we all have to take though, as our options are either 1) not try to learn these new things and risk eventually becoming obsolete or 2) spend too much time on something that fades away and then you also risk becoming obsolete.\nWhen I was young, single, and full of curiosity, it was certainly much easier to keep up with all of this. Now that I am older, a dad, and with much less time on my hands, I simply can’t keep up with it nor do I want to. The rate of new technologies coming out is now even much faster than before, so it’s damn near impossible to truly keep up with everything anyway. Which means we risk even more by choosing or not choosing. With the launch of AIs like ChatGPT and Bard, I think things have just advanced to a new level, maybe even a different game entirely. New jobs and industries were created overnight for AI content writers, artists, and more. \nSo, anyway, after I launched my Wine Buddies NFT collection on OpenSea, I created a Twitter account specifically for the collection as it was by far the biggest used platform for NFT collectors and was surprised at the reception I was receiving.

The Armenian owner of Taboon and Wine Bar in the Old City of Jerusalem was not surprised to receive a call the night of January 26 that a mob of Israeli settlers was attacking his bar in the Christian Quarter and shouting “Death to Arabs … Death to Christians.”\n\nAttacks against Christians in Jerusalem have been on the rise.\n\nA couple of days later, Armenians leaving a memorial service in the Armenian Quarter say they were attacked by Israeli settlers carrying sticks.\n\nIt isn’t only Armenian Christians:\n\nHostility by fundamentalist Jews towards Jerusalem’s Christian community is not new, and it is not just Armenian Christians who suffer from it. Priests of all denominations describe being spat at for years.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, 30 Christian graves at the Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery were desecrated. In the Armenian Quarter, vandals spray-painted “Death to Arabs, Christians and Armenians,” on the walls.\n\nAnd keep this in mind the next time you hear something from Christians United for Israel:\n\nAt the Church of the Flagellation, someone attacked a statue of Jesus with a hammer.\n\nAbout a century ago, the Christians made up a quarter of the population of Jerusalem; today, they represent less than one percent.  Consider that under Ottoman Muslim rule, the Christians were better protected than under the rule of Israeli Jews.\n\nThere are thirteen churches in Jerusalem; a small population divided so many ways.  It has come to the point where the fragmented Christian population is starting to understand that they must come together if they are to survive.\n\nChristians in Jerusalem are starting to increase engagement within and between communities.\n\n“The new generation is growing up with the idea that Christians must cooperate with each other in the city to keep the Christian presence,” said Dzernian. “If we keep saying that we will work alone, we will lose in the end.”\n\n“Occupation makes people very cold, very separate. ‘I am \\[Syriac\\], I am Catholic, I am Orthodox, I am Evangelist’,” remarked Hani the restaurant owner. “But with the threats, the violence, the vandalism, now the people are coming together. The churches are waking up. We were blind for 50 years, but no more.”\n\nI find this entire story very applicable to Christians in the West – really, the United States – today.  So much arguing, hostility, etc., between denominations and traditions.  Fighting about trees and losing sight of the forest.  We will continue to have less influence until we come to the point of Jerusalem’s Christians, it seems.\n\nBut by this, I don’t mean to include all who label themselves as Christians.  Those who cheer on the war machine, those who bow down at the call of masks and close churches at the whim of some politician, those who see the state of Israel – even with this persecution of Christians – as a state worthy of Christian devotion, those who cannot understand that God made them male and female; I exclude them all.  None of these will be useful in this fight.\n\nWhich brings me, once again, to Doug Wilson: [A Ham Sandwich With 34 Slices of Felonious Cheese](https://dougwils.com/books-and-culture/books/this-crowning-folly-and-thats-saying-something.html).  The first part of this is just hilarious; he is speaking of the charges against Trump:\n\nNot only is this banana republic stuff, it is not even competent banana republic stuff. Trump himself would tell you that if you are going to be a banana republic, you ought to be the best banana republic, putting all the other banana republics in the shade. All the other banana republics ought to seem worthless in comparison. But no, DA Bragg had a better idea. Why not a lame sauce banana republic?\n\nThis is beyond risible. This is what happens when any one of the 3 Stooges finally graduates from law school, and a well-connected relative gets them a cushy job as a prosecutor.\n\nBut that isn’t the important part.  At the end, he sets up the path forward:\n\n…I have been saying “don’t take the bait” for long enough that a number of you have asked, in various ways, “Okay, but if we shouldn’t take the bait, what do we take?” It is not enough for me to be telling you all what not to do, what should you do?\n\nHe says, sure – vote, go to the county commission meetings, speak out. But this isn’t the important stuff.  He gets to the important stuff – and saying better what I have been saying for some time:\n\nBut that is not where the real action is. The real action is within the church. \n\nI have been saying this in the context of moving this society toward liberty.  I have been saying this as the means by which the meaning crisis is addressed.\n\nThe main thing that Christians need to do now is get engaged with the government of the church they belong to. They should petition the elders to have the pastor address the sins of our generation from the pulpit.\n\nWhich comes back to my paragraph above: what are the sins of this generation?  Cheering on the war machine, bowing down to masks and to closing churches, worshipping the state of Israel, ignoring the order in which God created man and woman – and the purpose of each in His creation.  That’s my list.  Here is Wilson’s:\n\nAsk your elders to have your pastor preach on the sins of cowardice that have afflicted the leadership of the evangelical movement for a generation or more.

The Armenian owner of Taboon\nand Wine Bar in the Old City of Jerusalem was not surprised to receive a call\nthe night of January 26 that a mob of Israeli settlers was attacking his bar in\nthe Christian Quarter and shouting “Death to Arabs … Death to Christians.”\n\nAttacks against Christians in Jerusalem have been on the\nrise.\n\nA couple of days later, Armenians\nleaving a memorial service in the Armenian Quarter say they were attacked by\nIsraeli settlers carrying sticks.\n\nIt isn’t only Armenian Christians:\n\nHostility by fundamentalist Jews\ntowards Jerusalem’s Christian community is not new, and it is not just Armenian\nChristians who suffer from it. Priests of all denominations describe being spat\nat for years.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, 30\nChristian graves at the Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery were desecrated. In the\nArmenian Quarter, vandals spray-painted “Death to Arabs, Christians and\nArmenians,” on the walls.\n\nAnd keep this in mind the next time you hear something from\nChristians United for Israel:\n\nAt the Church of the Flagellation,\nsomeone attacked a statue of Jesus with a hammer.\n\nAbout a century ago, the Christians made up a quarter of the\npopulation of Jerusalem; today, they represent less than one percent.  Consider that under Ottoman Muslim rule, the\nChristians were better protected than under the rule of Israeli Jews.\n\nThere are thirteen churches in Jerusalem; a small population\ndivided so many ways.  It has come to the\npoint where the fragmented Christian population is starting to understand that\nthey must come together if they are to survive.\n\nChristians in Jerusalem are\nstarting to increase engagement within and between communities.\n\n“The new generation is growing up\nwith the idea that Christians must cooperate with each other in the city to\nkeep the Christian presence,” said Dzernian. “If we keep saying that we will\nwork alone, we will lose in the end.”\n\n“Occupation makes people very cold,\nvery separate. ‘I am [Syriac], I am Catholic, I am Orthodox, I am Evangelist’,”\nremarked Hani the restaurant owner. “But with the threats, the violence, the\nvandalism, now the people are coming together. The churches are waking up. We were\nblind for 50 years, but no more.”\n\nI find this entire story very applicable to Christians in\nthe West – really, the United States – today. \nSo much arguing, hostility, etc., between denominations and\ntraditions.  Fighting about trees and\nlosing sight of the forest.  We will\ncontinue to have less influence until we come to the point of Jerusalem’s\nChristians, it seems.\n\nBut by this, I don’t mean to include all who label\nthemselves as Christians.  Those who\ncheer on the war machine, those who bow down at the call of masks and close\nchurches at the whim of some politician, those who see the state of Israel –\neven with this persecution of Christians – as a state worthy of Christian\ndevotion, those who cannot understand that God made them male and female; I\nexclude them all.  None of these will be\nuseful in this fight.\n\nWhich brings me, once again, to Doug Wilson: A\nHam Sandwich With 34 Slices of Felonious Cheese.  The first part of this is just hilarious; he\nis speaking of the charges against Trump:\n\nNot only is this banana republic\nstuff, it is not even competent banana republic stuff. Trump himself would tell\nyou that if you are going to be a banana republic, you ought to be the best\nbanana republic, putting all the other banana republics in the shade. All the\nother banana republics ought to seem worthless in comparison. But no, DA Bragg\nhad a better idea. Why not a lame sauce banana republic?\n\nThis is beyond risible. This is\nwhat happens when any one of the 3 Stooges finally graduates from law school,\nand a well-connected relative gets them a cushy job as a prosecutor.\n\nBut that isn’t the important part.  At the end, he sets up the path forward:\n\n…I have been saying “don’t take the\nbait” for long enough that a number of you have asked, in various ways, “Okay,\nbut if we shouldn’t take the bait, what do we take?” It is not enough for me to\nbe telling you all what not to do, what should you do?\n\nHe says, sure – vote, go to the county commission meetings,\nspeak out. But this isn’t the important stuff. \nHe gets to the important stuff – and saying better what I have been saying\nfor some time:\n\nBut that is not where the real\naction is. The real action is within the church.  \n\nI have been saying this in the context of moving this\nsociety toward liberty.  I have been\nsaying this as the means by which the meaning crisis is addressed.\n\nThe main thing that Christians need\nto do now is get engaged with the government of the church they belong to. They\nshould petition the elders to have the pastor address the sins of our\ngeneration from the pulpit.\n\nWhich comes back to my paragraph above: what are the sins of\nthis generation?  Cheering on the war\nmachine, bowing down to masks and to closing churches, worshipping the state of\nIsrael, ignoring the order in which God created man and woman – and the purpose\nof each in His creation.  That’s my list.  Here is Wilson’s:\n\nAsk your elders to have your pastor\npreach on the sins of cowardice that have afflicted the leadership of the\nevangelical movement for a generation or more. There should be some recognition\nin it that the whole lockdown/masking issue as applied to the church was simply\na tyrannical beta test, used to gauge the softness of the church. Turns out it\nwas pretty soft. Ask your elders to have the church recognize that we are in a\ntime of cultural revolution, and to state from the pulpit that your\ncongregation stands against it, and that when the time of testing comes, your\nchurch will not comply.\n\nAnd, he concludes with the same idea I propose – that not\nall Christian churches will take on this task:\n\nAnd if you say to yourself, “this\nkind of thing will be really difficult to get them to say,” you at least now\nknow where the actual problem is.\n\nExactly.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo tie these two stories together: we, like today’s\nChristians in Jerusalem, will soon enough figure out that denominational\ndifferences are irrelevant given the fight we are in and given the enemy of\nthose arrayed against us.  The sooner\nthis realization penetrates, the better. \nBetter for liberty, better to fight against the meaning crisis. \n\nWhich brings me back to the verse for our day:\n\nEphesians 6: 12 For we do not\nwrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the\nauthorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the\nspiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\n\n\n\n"],["length","6878"],["r","https://zapworthy.com/load?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbionicmosquito.blogspot.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fthe-road-ahead.html%3Fm%3D1"],["published_at","1681926558"]]}]"###)

The churches are waking up. We were\nblind for 50 years, but no more.”\n\nI find this entire story very applicable to Christians in\nthe West – really, the United States – today. \nSo much arguing, hostility, etc., between denominations and\ntraditions.  Fighting about trees and\nlosing sight of the forest.  We will\ncontinue to have less influence until we come to the point of Jerusalem’s\nChristians, it seems.\n\nBut by this, I don’t mean to include all who label\nthemselves as Christians.  Those who\ncheer on the war machine, those who bow down at the call of masks and close\nchurches at the whim of some politician, those who see the state of Israel –\neven with this persecution of Christians – as a state worthy of Christian\ndevotion, those who cannot understand that God made them male and female; I\nexclude them all.  None of these will be\nuseful in this fight.\n\nWhich brings me, once again, to Doug Wilson: A\nHam Sandwich With 34 Slices of Felonious Cheese.  The first part of this is just hilarious; he\nis speaking of the charges against Trump:\n\nNot only is this banana republic\nstuff, it is not even competent banana republic stuff. Trump himself would tell\nyou that if you are going to be a banana republic, you ought to be the best\nbanana republic, putting all the other banana republics in the shade. All the\nother banana republics ought to seem worthless in comparison. But no, DA Bragg\nhad a better idea. Why not a lame sauce banana republic?\n\nThis is beyond risible. This is\nwhat happens when any one of the 3 Stooges finally graduates from law school,\nand a well-connected relative gets them a cushy job as a prosecutor.\n\nBut that isn’t the important part.  At the end, he sets up the path forward:\n\n…I have been saying “don’t take the\nbait” for long enough that a number of you have asked, in various ways, “Okay,\nbut if we shouldn’t take the bait, what do we take?” It is not enough for me to\nbe telling you all what not to do, what should you do?\n\nHe says, sure – vote, go to the county commission meetings,\nspeak out. But this isn’t the important stuff. \nHe gets to the important stuff – and saying better what I have been saying\nfor some time:\n\nBut that is not where the real\naction is. The real action is within the church.  \n\nI have been saying this in the context of moving this\nsociety toward liberty.  I have been\nsaying this as the means by which the meaning crisis is addressed.\n\nThe main thing that Christians need\nto do now is get engaged with the government of the church they belong to. They\nshould petition the elders to have the pastor address the sins of our\ngeneration from the pulpit.\n\nWhich comes back to my paragraph above: what are the sins of\nthis generation?  Cheering on the war\nmachine, bowing down to masks and to closing churches, worshipping the state of\nIsrael, ignoring the order in which God created man and woman – and the purpose\nof each in His creation.  That’s my list.  Here is Wilson’s:\n\nAsk your elders to have your pastor\npreach on the sins of cowardice that have afflicted the leadership of the\nevangelical movement for a generation or more. There should be some recognition\nin it that the whole lockdown/masking issue as applied to the church was simply\na tyrannical beta test, used to gauge the softness of the church. Turns out it\nwas pretty soft. Ask your elders to have the church recognize that we are in a\ntime of cultural revolution, and to state from the pulpit that your\ncongregation stands against it, and that when the time of testing comes, your\nchurch will not comply.\n\nAnd, he concludes with the same idea I propose – that not\nall Christian churches will take on this task:\n\nAnd if you say to yourself, “this\nkind of thing will be really difficult to get them to say,” you at least now\nknow where the actual problem is.\n\nExactly.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo tie these two stories together: we, like today’s\nChristians in Jerusalem, will soon enough figure out that denominational\ndifferences are irrelevant given the fight we are in and given the enemy of\nthose arrayed against us.  The sooner\nthis realization penetrates, the better. \nBetter for liberty, better to fight against the meaning crisis. \n\nWhich brings me back to the verse for our day:\n\nEphesians 6: 12 For we do not\nwrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the\nauthorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the\nspiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\n\n\n\n"],["length","6878"],["r","https://zapworthy.com/load?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbionicmosquito.blogspot.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fthe-road-ahead.html%3Fm%3D1"],["published_at","1681926172"]]}]"###)

No entanto, quando comecei a trabalhar nisso, percebi que pode ser uma boa ideia primeiro dedicar um post para recapitular as preliminares que será necessário para entender o canal Taproot de acompanhamento artigos. Então aqui está você!\n\nVisão geral\n-----------\n\nEste post abordará alguns princípios básicos sobre as saídas Taproot e como gastá-las através dos caminhos da chave ou do script. Também cobrirá o fluxo MuSig2 entre duas partes assinantes. Observe que não vou entrar em detalhes extremos para nenhum dos esses tópicos. Em vez disso, este post visa refrescar sua memória sobre esses tópicos ou fornecendo uma compreensão suficiente de como o Taproot produz e O MuSig2 funciona para que os artigos de acompanhamento sejam mais facilmente digeríveis. Há sim melhores artigos por aí, se você quiser entrar no âmago da questão esses tópicos e, claro, você sempre pode conferir os BIPs se estiver corajoso: [Assinaturas de Schnorr](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki), [Taprootar](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki), [Tapscript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki) e [MuSig2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki).\n\nOk, chega de bate-papo. Sobre as coisas boas!\n\nUma nota rápida nas chaves públicas do BIP340\n---------------------------------------------\n\nAs chaves públicas serão codificadas principalmente como matrizes de 32 bytes, em vez do habitual Representação de chave pública compactada de 33 bytes com a qual você pode estar acostumado. Se o a curva secp256k1 é plotada em um campo não finito ( como mostrado abaixo ), então você pode veja que para cada coordenada x, existem duas coordenadas y possíveis. Desde o curva é realmente sobre um campo finito com uma ordem ímpar, uma coordenada y para um dado x-coordenate sempre será par e o outro será estranho. O suposição para chaves públicas codificadas de 32 bytes é que a coordenada y é sempre o mesmo. Isso significa que se você deseja criar uma assinatura válida do BIP340, mas sua chave privada, `d`, produz uma chave pública, `P`, com uma estranha coordenada y, então tudo que você precisa fazer é _negar_ sua chave privada. Isso produzirá público chave `P’` que tem a mesma coordenada x que sua chave pública original, mas com uma até y-coordenate. Para mais informações sobre chaves públicas BIP340 e assinaturas ( também conhecidas como assinaturas Schnorr ), verifique o [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) em si.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/curve.png#center)\n\nSaídas de raiz\n--------------\n\nUma saída de raiz principal aparece no `scriptPubKey` seção de uma transação ( just como todas as outras saídas ) e tem a seguinte forma:\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/tr-output.png#center)\n\nO `OP_1` indica que esta é uma saída SegWit Versão 1 ( a.k.a. Taprootar saída ) e a seguir são 32 bytes que representam a chave de saída ( consulte [Chaves públicas BIP340](#a-quick-note-on-bip340-public-keys) acima de ). Eu vou frequentemente usar `Q` para se referir a esta chave. Para dar uma imagem completa, aqui está um Taproot saída em uma transação:\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/tr-output-in-tx.png#center)\n\nOk legal. Mas o que exatamente há nesta saída? É como uma saída P2PK? Não. Isso seria coxo. A verdade é que essa saída simples pode ser uma enorme variedade de coisas diferentes. Poderia ser uma chave pública simples e simples ( sim, como um P2PK ). Poderia ser uma chave pública n-de-n MuSig2. Também poderia ter um monte de opções de ramificação de script, ou pode até ser uma combinação de todas as opções acima! Vamos quebre essas opções um pouco.\n\nSaídas de chave única ou n-de-n MuSig2\n--------------------------------------\n\nSe você quiser apenas criar uma saída que envie para uma única chave pública, `P`, então isso é fácil de fazer. Nesse caso, sua chave de saída, `Q`, apenas se torna seu chave, `P`, que é freqüentemente chamado de _chave interna_.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/tr-single-key.png#center)\n\nPara gastar essa saída, basta fornecer uma assinatura BIP340 no testemunha que você calcularia usando a chave privada, `d`, usado para derivar `P`. Veja a nota explicada no [BIP340 Público Chaves](#a-quick-note-on-bip340-public-keys) seção sobre possivelmente precisar negue sua chave privada primeiro.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/tr-single-key-spend.png#center)\n\nAgora, e se você quisesse usar uma chave pública MuSig2 agregada? Acontece que isso vai parecer _exatamente_ o mesmo na cadeia que para a chave única caso explicado acima! Tudo o que muda são os passos que você e seu companheiro os assinantes precisam usar para configurar a chave pública agregada e depois calcular a assinatura final. Mas uma vez que tudo isso esteja completo, o que acaba na aparência da cadeia não é diferente.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-output.png#center)\n\nCaminhos de scripts\n-------------------\n\nAqui é onde a mágica realmente acontece. Você também pode ter a opção de gastando sua saída Taproot através de um script _e_ cada saída pode ter vários scripts dos quais pode ser gasto. Outra coisa legal é que, se você optar por inclua caminhos de script na saída Taproot, você ainda pode adicionar uma chave regular caminho como antes. Digamos, por exemplo, que você deseja gastar seu saída a qualquer momento, mas você também deseja adicionar três caminhos de script para que ele possa também ser gasto em outros cenários: talvez após 30 dias você queira que seu parceiro ser capaz de gastar a saída. Esse seria um caminho de script. Se você também tem dois outros caminhos de script ( talvez um seja um multi-sig 2 de 3 e o outro exija um revele pré-imagem ), então sua saída de Taproot será construída da seguinte forma:\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/tr-whole-thing.png#center)\n\nVamos percorrer um pouco o diagrama acima:\n\nPrimeiro, os três scripts (`Script A`, `Script B` e `Script C`) são todos colocados em um [Árvore Merkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) como mostrado no canto inferior direito. A raiz desta árvore Merkle é então agitado junto com nossa chave interna, `P`, para obter o ajuste de 32 bytes, `t`. Este ajuste é convertido em sua forma de ponto de curva elíptica multiplicando-o por o ponto gerador, `G`, para obter `T` que é então adicionado à nossa chave interna, `P`, para obter a chave de saída final, `Q`. Eu pulei algumas coisas aqui como os detalhes das codificações de scripts e também como os scripts são hash a árvore Merkle, então verifique os BIPs relevantes, se você estiver interessado.\n\nTudo bem - nossa saída sofisticada de Taproot foi configurada! Mas agora ... como gastamos isto? Existem duas maneiras de gastar essa transação: a primeira é através do chave interna, `P`. Chamamos isso de [_caminho principal gastar_](#key-path-spends). O de outra maneira é através de um dos scripts na árvore. Esse tipo de gasto é chamado de [_caminho do script gasto_](#script-path-spends).\n\n### Gastos com caminho-chave\n\nOs gastos pelo caminho principal são muito simples e são semelhantes aos gastos com a produção se fosse apenas uma chave normal não tecida, conforme descrito [mais cedo em](#single-key-or-n-of-n-musig2-outputs). A única diferença é que você vai precisa ajustar sua chave privada, `d`, com o ajuste, `t`. Em outras palavras, seu nova chave privada se torna `d + t` qual é o que você usará para calcular seu assinatura. É isso aí! Se você gastar a saída pelo caminho principal, não haverá precisa revelar qualquer um dos scripts e, portanto, qualquer pessoa que esteja olhando para os gastos na cadeia não terá idéia de que a produção teve o potencial de ser gasta através de um caminho do script.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/tr-tweaked-pk.png#center)\n\n### Gastos com caminhos de script\n\nGastar através de um dos caminhos do script requer um pouco mais de complexidade testemunha. Digamos que queremos gastar via `Script B`. Precisamos fazer alguns coisas para convencer um verificador de que temos o direito de gastar a saída:\n\n1.  Devemos fornecer um script de gastos válido para `Script B`.\n2.  Precisamos provar que `Script B` é realmente incorporado na saída.\n\nO passo 1 é bem simples: basta fornecer o script de testemunha válido para `Script B` junto com `Script B` em si. O passo 2 está um pouco mais envolvido. Para provar isso `Script B` está incorporado em `Q`, precisamos dar ao verificador todo o edifício blocos necessários para realmente construir `Q`. Esses blocos de construção são coloque o que é chamado de bloco de controle “ ”. A primeira coisa no bloco de controle é a chave interna, `P`. Ele também contém a prova Merkle que permite verificador para calcular a raiz da árvore Merkle. A testemunha já inclui `Script B` ( foi necessário para a etapa 1 ), para que o verificador possa calcular `hB` ( veja o diagrama acima mostrando a construção da árvore Merkle ), e então só precisamos fornecer `hA` e `hC`. O validador usará estes hashes para calcular o `script_root` e então hash isso junto com o chave interna, `P`, para chegar ao ajuste, `t`. O validador pode então calcular o ponto de ajuste correspondente, `T`, adicione isso à chave interna, `P`, para obter a chave de saída, `Q`. A última coisa que o bloco de controle deve incluir é um pouco indicando se a final `Q` ponto tem uma coordenada y estranha ou mesmo que o validador pode verificar se o `Q` eles computados tem o correto coordenadas y.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/script-spending-witness.png#center)\n\nÉ importante observar que nenhum conhecimento de `d` ( a chave privada para o chave interna, `P`) foi necessário para gastar via `Script B` ( assumindo, é claro aquilo `Script B` não envolve `P`). Outra coisa legal é que fizemos não precisa revelar o conteúdo dos outros scripts na árvore, apenas seus hashes.\n\n### Tweaks BIP86\n\nHá um truque inteligente que pode ser usado se você deseja criar uma saída sem caminho de script que permita provar também a terceiros que existem não é um caminho de script. Tudo o que você faz é construir `Q` como se você estivesse construindo um saída com caminhos de script _mas_ a raiz do script é deixada vazia.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/bip86-tweak.png#center)\n\nGastar essa saída agora só pode ser feito através do caminho principal de gastos usando chave `d + t`. Então, `P` pode ser fornecido a terceiros que desejam provas de que não há caminho de script. Eles usariam `P` calcular `t` e `T` e depois verificaria que `P + T` é igual à chave de saída, `Q`. Mais informações sobre isso pode ser encontrado em [BIP86](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0086.mediawiki#address-derivation).\n\nCom o softfork Taproot, os nós de bitcoin agora têm um entendimento do BIP340 assinaturas ( ou assinaturas Schnorr ). A beleza dessas assinaturas é a linearidade: o proprietário da chave pública `P_1` pode criar uma assinatura parcial, `sig_1` para a mensagem `msg` e o proprietário da chave pública `P_2` pode criar `sig_2` para a mesma mensagem. As duas partes poderão combinar suas assinaturas de tal forma que `sig` Onde `sig = sig_1 + sig_2` é uma assinatura válida para o agregado de suas chaves públicas: `P = P_1 + P_2`.\n\nIsso é muito legal porque significa que, em vez de precisar criar um longo script multisig n-of-n e, em seguida, precisando pagar pelo espaço blockchain para armazenar cada um dos `n` assinaturas, apenas uma assinatura será necessária e nenhum script longo será necessário. Em vez disso, apenas uma única chave pública ( que é realmente uma _agregado_ chave pública ) precisa aparecer na cadeia.\n\nA parte complicada aqui é tudo o que precisa acontecer _fora da cadeia_ durante o configuração dessa chave pública agregada, bem como para a criação da assinatura. [MuSig2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki) é o protocolo que define como isso deve ser feito. As várias etapas foram cuidadosamente pensadas para manter o processo sem confiança e para proteger as partes de ataques como chave cancelamento.\n\n[BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki) define o protocolo MuSig2 junto com vários algoritmos que deve ser usado para as várias etapas do processo. Desde o objetivo disso O artigo é para fornecer todos os blocos de construção necessários para o entendimento Canais Lightning Taproot, falarei apenas sobre o MuSig2 no nível da API usando os algoritmos definidos e se concentrarão mais em como será usado no Lightning. Se você quiser se aprofundar mais, pode conferir o próprio BIP. eu tenho também implementou todos os métodos MuSig2 do zero [aqui](https://github.com/ellemouton/schnorr/tree/master/musig2) se você são o tipo de pessoa que prefere olhar para o código.\n\nMuSig2 vs n-de-n Multisig\n-------------------------\n\nUma coisa importante a ter em mente é que, com saídas multisig n-de-n, festas pode gerar suas assinaturas completamente independentemente das outras partes. Como desde que tenham a mensagem a ser assinada juntamente com sua chave privada, eles pode criar uma assinatura. Essa assinatura pode ser distribuída com segurança ao outras partes e, eventualmente, a testemunha da transação terá todas `n` assinaturas. Em outras palavras: nenhuma interação é necessária entre as partes em hora de assinar. Com n-de-n _MuSig2_ este não é o caso, pois existe um chave pública na cadeia e, portanto, uma assinatura precisa ser produzida. O `n` partidos precisam interagir um com o outro para produzir essa assinatura final.\n\nExplicação por exemplo\n----------------------\n\nVamos analisar o caso em que duas partes, Alice e Bob, querem montar um 2-de-2 saída MuSig2 e crie uma assinatura para gastar com ela.\n\nEste primeiro diagrama mostra o estado inicial: Alice e Bob têm chaves privadas e as chaves públicas correspondentes e atualmente as duas partes não têm compartilhamento conhecimento.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-1.png#center)\n\nQuando as duas partes decidirem construir uma saída juntas, elas primeiro precisa trocar chaves públicas. Ambas as partes usarão o MuSig2 `KeySort` algoritmo para classificar as chaves e depois o `KeyAgg` algoritmo para agregar o chaves. Isso produzirá a chave agregada, `P_agg`, qual seria a chave que apareceria na saída da transação.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-2.png#center)\n\nDepois que Alice e Bob tiverem uma mensagem compartilhada, eles querem assinar (, o que provavelmente seja a transação de gastos ), eles podem passar para a fase de assinatura.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-3.png#center)\n\nA primeira etapa da fase de assinatura envolve cada parte gerando não-cess. Eles vão cada um gera um nonce secreto, chamado de `secnonce`, e do `secnonce` o nonce público associado, chamado de `pubnonce`, pode ser determinado. Observe que cada `secnonce` é realmente composto de duas chaves privadas e cada `pubnonce` é composto pelas duas chaves públicas associadas a essas chaves privadas. Os detalhes por que existem duas não-cidades está fora do escopo desta postagem. Alice e Bob precisará trocar as não-fabricadas públicas e, em seguida, ambas as partes usarão o MuSig2 `NonceAgg` função para determinar o nonce agregado: `aggnonce`. Nota que esta etapa não teve nada a ver com a mensagem a ser assinada, o que significa que a etapa pode realmente ocorrer antes que a mensagem a ser assinada seja conhecida.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-4.png#center)\n\nQuando as não-faixas públicas foram trocadas e ambas as partes conhecem a mensagem para ser assinado, cada parte pode usar o MuSig2 `Sign` função para produzir parcial assinaturas.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-5.png#center)\n\nO passo final é que as partes troquem suas assinaturas parciais. Cada a festa pode então usar o MuSig2 `PartialSigAgg` função para calcular a final assinatura. Esta assinatura será uma assinatura válida para `P_agg` sobre o mensagem, `msg`.\n\n![](https://zapworthy.com/taprootPrelims/musig-6.png#center)\n\nÉ importante familiarizar-se com o fluxo MuSig2 acima, porque será usado com muita frequência nos próximos artigos. Nos canais Taproot, a produção de financiamento de um canal será uma chave pública agregada MuSig2. Isso significa que todo transação de compromisso criada que gasta com a produção de financiamento precisará passe por esse fluxo de assinatura. Como os estados dos canais em Lightning são assimétricos, isso também significa que esse fluxo precisará ocorrer duas vezes por atualização de estado: uma vez assinar a transação de compromisso local e uma vez assinar a remota.

Isso significa que se você deseja criar uma assinatura válida do BIP340, mas\nsua chave privada, d, produz uma chave pública, P, com uma estranha coordenada y,\nentão tudo que você precisa fazer é negar sua chave privada. Isso produzirá público\nchave P’ que tem a mesma coordenada x que sua chave pública original, mas com uma\naté y-coordenate. Para mais informações sobre chaves públicas BIP340 e\nassinaturas ( também conhecidas como assinaturas Schnorr ), verifique o BIP\nem si.Saídas de raizUma saída de raiz principal aparece no scriptPubKey seção de uma transação ( just\ncomo todas as outras saídas ) e tem a seguinte forma:O OP_1 indica que esta é uma saída SegWit Versão 1 ( a.k.a. Taprootar\nsaída ) e a seguir são 32 bytes que representam a chave de saída ( consulte\nChaves públicas BIP340 acima de ). Eu vou frequentemente\nusar Q para se referir a esta chave. Para dar uma imagem completa, aqui está um Taproot\nsaída em uma transação:Ok legal. Mas o que exatamente há nesta saída? É como uma saída P2PK? Não.\nIsso seria coxo. A verdade é que essa saída simples pode ser uma enorme\nvariedade de coisas diferentes. Poderia ser uma chave pública simples e simples ( sim, como\num P2PK ). Poderia ser uma chave pública n-de-n MuSig2. Também poderia ter um monte de\nopções de ramificação de script, ou pode até ser uma combinação de todas as opções acima! Vamos\nquebre essas opções um pouco.Saídas de chave única ou n-de-n MuSig2Se você quiser apenas criar uma saída que envie para uma única chave pública, P,\nentão isso é fácil de fazer. Nesse caso, sua chave de saída, Q, apenas se torna seu\nchave, P, que é freqüentemente chamado de chave interna.Para gastar essa saída, basta fornecer uma assinatura BIP340 no\ntestemunha que você calcularia usando a chave privada, d, usado para derivar\nP. Veja a nota explicada no BIP340 Público\nChaves seção sobre possivelmente precisar\nnegue sua chave privada primeiro.Agora, e se você quisesse usar uma chave pública MuSig2 agregada?\nAcontece que isso vai parecer exatamente o mesmo na cadeia que para a chave única\ncaso explicado acima! Tudo o que muda são os passos que você e seu companheiro\nos assinantes precisam usar para configurar a chave pública agregada e depois calcular\na assinatura final. Mas uma vez que tudo isso esteja completo, o que acaba na aparência da cadeia\nnão é diferente.Caminhos de scriptsAqui é onde a mágica realmente acontece. Você também pode ter a opção de\ngastando sua saída Taproot através de um script e cada saída pode ter vários\nscripts dos quais pode ser gasto. Outra coisa legal é que, se você optar por\ninclua caminhos de script na saída Taproot, você ainda pode adicionar uma chave regular\ncaminho como antes. Digamos, por exemplo, que você deseja gastar seu\nsaída a qualquer momento, mas você também deseja adicionar três caminhos de script para que ele possa\ntambém ser gasto em outros cenários: talvez após 30 dias você queira que seu parceiro\nser capaz de gastar a saída. Esse seria um caminho de script. Se você também tem dois\noutros caminhos de script ( talvez um seja um multi-sig 2 de 3 e o outro exija um\nrevele pré-imagem ), então sua saída de Taproot será construída da seguinte forma:Vamos percorrer um pouco o diagrama acima:Primeiro, os três scripts (Script A, Script B e Script C) são todos colocados\nem um Árvore Merkle como mostrado no canto inferior direito. A raiz desta árvore Merkle\né então agitado junto com nossa chave interna, P, para obter o ajuste de 32 bytes, t.\nEste ajuste é convertido em sua forma de ponto de curva elíptica multiplicando-o por\no ponto gerador, G, para obter T que é então adicionado à nossa chave interna,\nP, para obter a chave de saída final, Q. Eu pulei algumas coisas aqui\ncomo os detalhes das codificações de scripts e também como os scripts são hash\na árvore Merkle, então verifique os BIPs relevantes, se você estiver interessado.Tudo bem - nossa saída sofisticada de Taproot foi configurada! Mas agora ... como gastamos\nisto? Existem duas maneiras de gastar essa transação: a primeira é através do\nchave interna, P. Chamamos isso de caminho principal gastar. O\nde outra maneira é através de um dos scripts na árvore. Esse tipo de gasto é chamado de\ncaminho do script gasto.Gastos com caminho-chaveOs gastos pelo caminho principal são muito simples e são semelhantes aos gastos com a produção\nse fosse apenas uma chave normal não tecida, conforme descrito mais cedo\nem. A única diferença é que você vai\nprecisa ajustar sua chave privada, d, com o ajuste, t. Em outras palavras, seu\nnova chave privada se torna d + t qual é o que você usará para calcular seu\nassinatura. É isso aí! Se você gastar a saída pelo caminho principal, não haverá\nprecisa revelar qualquer um dos scripts e, portanto, qualquer pessoa que esteja olhando para os gastos na cadeia\nnão terá idéia de que a produção teve o potencial de ser gasta através de um\ncaminho do script.Gastos com caminhos de scriptGastar através de um dos caminhos do script requer um pouco mais de complexidade\ntestemunha. Digamos que queremos gastar via Script B. Precisamos fazer alguns\ncoisas para convencer um verificador de que temos o direito de gastar a saída:Devemos fornecer um script de gastos válido para Script B.Precisamos provar que Script B é realmente incorporado na saída.O passo 1 é bem simples: basta fornecer o script de testemunha válido para Script B\njunto com Script B em si. O passo 2 está um pouco mais envolvido. Para provar isso\nScript B está incorporado em Q, precisamos dar ao verificador todo o edifício\nblocos necessários para realmente construir Q. Esses blocos de construção são\ncoloque o que é chamado de bloco de controle “ ”. A primeira coisa no bloco de controle\né a chave interna, P. Ele também contém a prova Merkle que permite\nverificador para calcular a raiz da árvore Merkle. A testemunha já inclui\nScript B ( foi necessário para a etapa 1 ), para que o verificador possa calcular\nhB ( veja o diagrama acima mostrando a construção da árvore Merkle ),\ne então só precisamos fornecer hA e hC. O validador usará estes\nhashes para calcular o script_root e então hash isso junto com o\nchave interna, P, para chegar ao ajuste, t. O validador pode então\ncalcular o ponto de ajuste correspondente, T, adicione isso à chave interna, P,\npara obter a chave de saída, Q. A última coisa que o bloco de controle deve incluir\né um pouco indicando se a final Q ponto tem uma coordenada y estranha ou mesmo\nque o validador pode verificar se o Q eles computados tem o correto\ncoordenadas y.É importante observar que nenhum conhecimento de d ( a chave privada para o\nchave interna, P) foi necessário para gastar via Script B ( assumindo, é claro\naquilo Script B não envolve P). Outra coisa legal é que fizemos\nnão precisa revelar o conteúdo dos outros scripts na árvore, apenas seus\nhashes.Tweaks BIP86Há um truque inteligente que pode ser usado se você deseja criar uma saída\nsem caminho de script que permita provar também a terceiros que existem\nnão é um caminho de script. Tudo o que você faz é construir Q como se você estivesse construindo um\nsaída com caminhos de script mas a raiz do script é deixada vazia.Gastar essa saída agora só pode ser feito através do caminho principal de gastos usando\nchave d + t. Então, P pode ser fornecido a terceiros que desejam provas de que\nnão há caminho de script. Eles usariam P calcular t e T e depois\nverificaria que P + T é igual à chave de saída, Q. Mais informações sobre isso\npode ser encontrado em BIP86.Com o softfork Taproot, os nós de bitcoin agora têm um entendimento do BIP340\nassinaturas ( ou assinaturas Schnorr ). A beleza dessas assinaturas é a\nlinearidade: o proprietário da chave pública P_1 pode criar uma assinatura parcial,\nsig_1 para a mensagem msg e o proprietário da chave pública P_2 pode criar\nsig_2 para a mesma mensagem. As duas partes poderão combinar suas\nassinaturas de tal forma que sig Onde sig = sig_1 + sig_2 é uma assinatura válida para\no agregado de suas chaves públicas: P = P_1 + P_2.Isso é muito legal porque significa que, em vez de precisar criar um longo\nscript multisig n-of-n e, em seguida, precisando pagar pelo espaço blockchain para armazenar\ncada um dos n assinaturas, apenas uma assinatura será necessária e nenhum script longo\nserá necessário. Em vez disso, apenas uma única chave pública ( que é realmente uma\nagregado chave pública ) precisa aparecer na cadeia.A parte complicada aqui é tudo o que precisa acontecer fora da cadeia durante o\nconfiguração dessa chave pública agregada, bem como para a criação da\nassinatura. MuSig2 é o protocolo que define como isso deve ser\nfeito. As várias etapas foram cuidadosamente pensadas para manter\no processo sem confiança e para proteger as partes de ataques como chave\ncancelamento.BIP327 define o protocolo MuSig2 junto com vários algoritmos\nque deve ser usado para as várias etapas do processo. Desde o objetivo disso\nO artigo é para fornecer todos os blocos de construção necessários para o entendimento\nCanais Lightning Taproot, falarei apenas sobre o MuSig2 no nível da API usando\nos algoritmos definidos e se concentrarão mais em como será usado no Lightning.\nSe você quiser se aprofundar mais, pode conferir o próprio BIP. eu tenho\ntambém implementou todos os métodos MuSig2 do zero aqui se você\nsão o tipo de pessoa que prefere olhar para o código.MuSig2 vs n-de-n MultisigUma coisa importante a ter em mente é que, com saídas multisig n-de-n, festas\npode gerar suas assinaturas completamente independentemente das outras partes. Como\ndesde que tenham a mensagem a ser assinada juntamente com sua chave privada, eles\npode criar uma assinatura. Essa assinatura pode ser distribuída com segurança ao\noutras partes e, eventualmente, a testemunha da transação terá todas n\nassinaturas. Em outras palavras: nenhuma interação é necessária entre as partes em\nhora de assinar. Com n-de-n MuSig2 este não é o caso, pois existe um\nchave pública na cadeia e, portanto, uma assinatura precisa ser produzida. O n partidos\nprecisam interagir um com o outro para produzir essa assinatura final.Explicação por exemploVamos analisar o caso em que duas partes, Alice e Bob, querem montar um\n2-de-2 saída MuSig2 e crie uma assinatura para gastar com ela.Este primeiro diagrama mostra o estado inicial: Alice e Bob têm chaves privadas\ne as chaves públicas correspondentes e atualmente as duas partes não têm compartilhamento\nconhecimento.Quando as duas partes decidirem construir uma saída juntas, elas primeiro\nprecisa trocar chaves públicas. Ambas as partes usarão o MuSig2 KeySort\nalgoritmo para classificar as chaves e depois o KeyAgg algoritmo para agregar o\nchaves. Isso produzirá a chave agregada, P_agg, qual seria a chave que\napareceria na saída da transação.Depois que Alice e Bob tiverem uma mensagem compartilhada, eles querem assinar (, o que\nprovavelmente seja a transação de gastos ), eles podem passar para a fase de assinatura.A primeira etapa da fase de assinatura envolve cada parte gerando não-cess. Eles vão\ncada um gera um nonce secreto, chamado de secnonce, e do secnonce o\nnonce público associado, chamado de pubnonce, pode ser determinado. Observe que\ncada secnonce é realmente composto de duas chaves privadas e cada pubnonce é\ncomposto pelas duas chaves públicas associadas a essas chaves privadas. Os detalhes\npor que existem duas não-cidades está fora do escopo desta postagem. Alice e Bob\nprecisará trocar as não-fabricadas públicas e, em seguida, ambas as partes usarão o\nMuSig2 NonceAgg função para determinar o nonce agregado: aggnonce. Nota\nque esta etapa não teve nada a ver com a mensagem a ser assinada, o que significa que\na etapa pode realmente ocorrer antes que a mensagem a ser assinada seja conhecida.Quando as não-faixas públicas foram trocadas e ambas as partes conhecem a mensagem para\nser assinado, cada parte pode usar o MuSig2 Sign função para produzir parcial\nassinaturas.O passo final é que as partes troquem suas assinaturas parciais. Cada\na festa pode então usar o MuSig2 PartialSigAgg função para calcular a final\nassinatura. Esta assinatura será uma assinatura válida para P_agg sobre o\nmensagem, msg.É importante familiarizar-se com o fluxo MuSig2 acima, porque será\nusado com muita frequência nos próximos artigos. Nos canais Taproot, a produção de financiamento\nde um canal será uma chave pública agregada MuSig2. Isso significa que todo\ntransação de compromisso criada que gasta com a produção de financiamento precisará\npasse por esse fluxo de assinatura. Como os estados dos canais em Lightning são assimétricos,\nisso também significa que esse fluxo precisará ocorrer duas vezes por atualização de estado: uma vez\nassinar a transação de compromisso local e uma vez assinar a remota.

Thanks for reading!**\n\nA couple of years ago, NFTs were becoming all the rage and as a tech guy for over 25 years I was curious to learn how these massive collections were being created so quickly. After reading a few “How To” articles, I decided to give it a go and created my own goofy wine themed collection called [the Wine Buddies](https://winebuddies.io/) for the fun of it. A few of my online friends thought I should make them available for sale and see what would happen.\n\nI [posted a thorough article about my process](https://www.sonofvin.com/2021/11/14/introducing-the-wine-buddies-my-first-generative-nft-art-collection/) and the eventual steps of putting them up online on OpenSea, an NFT marketplace. Ultimately I was doing this as a learning experience. Though everyone dreams of something going wildly successful, I was happy that I had accomplished my original goal, learning something new.\n\nJust a small side note before we move on: I’ve worked as a software engineer with paying customers since 1996 and have seen so many technologies and computer languages come and go over the years. There have been plenty of them claiming to be game changers and the next popular thing all coders must learn in order to stay relevant and employable. It can get rather draining and tedious to learn new techniques and discard old bad habits every few years. Some of it is relatable to what you’ve learned before, though every so often something is so new and unique it takes much more focus to truly understand. The worst is when these new trending techs never reach their true potential and can make you feel like you’ve wasted too much time on something that will no longer be used. It’s a risk we all have to take though, as our options are either 1) not try to learn these new things and risk eventually becoming obsolete or 2) spend too much time on something that fades away and then you also risk becoming obsolete.\n\nWhen I was young, single, and full of curiosity, it was certainly much easier to keep up with all of this. Now that I am older, a dad, and with much less time on my hands, I simply can’t keep up with it nor do I want to. The rate of new technologies coming out is now even much faster than before, so it’s damn near impossible to truly keep up with everything anyway. Which means we risk even more by choosing or not choosing. With the launch of AIs like ChatGPT and Bard, I think things have just advanced to a new level, maybe even a different game entirely. New jobs and industries were created overnight for AI content writers, artists, and more.\n\nSo, anyway, after I launched my [Wine Buddies NFT collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/wine-buddies), I created a Twitter account specifically for the collection as it was by far the biggest used platform for NFT collectors and was surprised at the reception I was receiving. Due to this initial buzz, I even had them ranked on [Rarity Sniper](https://raritysniper.com/wine-buddies), a popular website for NFT collectors, to see which of the Wine Buddies were the most unique. All of this fell in line with what everyone else was doing with their collections, so I figured “why not”. Not too long after this my calendar was quickly being filled up as I was being invited to speak on Twitter Spaces about my collection both to the wine and NFT communities.\n\n![Nostr and wine](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-wine-2.jpg)  \nThen suddenly, one day Wine Buddies’ Twitter account was suspended without any explanation and all of those Spaces I was supposed to attend were now unreachable. All I ever posted about was wine and the Wine Buddies NFT collection itself. No politics, hate, etc. As a web developer, I knew they had an API for us to test and work with in order to help automate our activities. As a one man team, this made me curious what they offered and how it could help me. I had worked with it in the past for clients, but it had been a while. I had spent one morning testing out their API and what their documentation showed we could do with it. Only a few hours later my account was suspended. My best guess was that something (that their own documentation explained how to do!) triggered this suspension. I never received a response from Twitter support as to why. Appeals went unanswered. No phone number to call, their own support account would never respond to direct messages. Months went by and my NFT project lost all of its momentum and over time NFTs in general lost their buzz.\n\nI never once received any emails from Twitter directly. Almost a year after this, I tried logging into that account and noticed bolded text saying it was now Permanently Suspended with just a link to their Terms of Service. Something on there TOS was what I had apparently broke and it was up to me to figure out exactly what.\n\nThe entire ordeal made me disheartened more than I had expected. This went from something I was doing for fun, to _Wow, this is really taking off_, to frustration, and ultimately sadness. It was all entirely out of my control and I should have known better. Social media companies are all businesses and ultimately they get to choose who uses them and they don’t have to explain why either. _Free speech_ is not covered once you start using their business. We’re just the product (our data) that they sell to their advertisers. One tiny ant is meaningless to the greater hive mind. They also get to choose what content we see and who your own posts get to be seen by. Try creating a new account on many of those platforms now. It’s extremely hard to get seen by anyone unless you are already famous.\n\nIt really made me not want to use their service anymore (and frankly most of social media) and I nearly stopped using my main account afterwards. Still to this day, the Wine Buddies NFT account is permanently suspended. A few years before this incident, my personal Facebook account was also suspended for no reason. I rarely commented on anything and mostly just posted family pictures on my own timeline. I appealed and did eventually get that account back but never once received a reason why it even happened.\n\nAfter my WineBuddies NFT Twitter incident, I finally started looking into decentralized social media platforms. Decentralization in a nutshell means that no one person or organization has full control. Ultimately all of the individuals involved have a say in things. It’s true that a huge mass of people could band together to move the flow a certain way, but it still couldn’t be fully controlled. Decentralization has been slowly gaining attention across all multimedia platforms (video, social media, etc) but it wasn’t until Elon Musk bought Twitter that decentralized platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) were suddenly gaining broader media attention due to the growing concern of censorship. Then late last year, former Twitter CEO and current Block CEO Jack Dorsey catapulted Nostr’s media attention by announcing a major donation to help push development forward faster.\n\n![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-and-Wine.jpg)  \nI did setup a Mastodon site for my [film and music industry individuals](https://filmmusic.social/) to communicate, but I have personally landed on Nostr as my preferred decentralized censorship-free social media platform. Like Mastodon, Nostr uses relays to spread data around. Nostr which stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” has a purple ostrich as its mascot and is still heavy on the technical side to use, but so was the early days of the Internet. Users are often dubbed Nostriches, and posts are filled with jokes and memes no different than most other social media platforms, yet there is heavy tech talk focusing on building out the platform every week.\n\nThe way it is built, anyone can setup a website that lets users interact within the protocol. There is an ever growing list of dozens of web clients and other [projects here](https://www.nostr.net/).\n\nOne of its major differences from Mastodon, is that while Mastodon still requires email addresses and passwords to login, Nostr uses generated private and public keys for every user. So you don’t need to have an email address, you just need to keep your keys safe. There are some drawbacks to this idea though. Like if you lose your private key, you’re out of luck. No one can get it back for you. Or if someone gains access to where you are storing it and starts using it, then your account is compromised and you will need to create a new one. The positive to using generated keys is that it can be as anonymous as you wish and is entirely self controlled considering even your e-mail address or domain name providers can block your usage.\n\nAnyone can setup a relay if they are technically inclined enough, and they can allow anyone to post or read data from their relays. Ultimately your social global feed is an accumulation of posts from all of the relays you are attaching to. You can also follow people just like on other platforms and then just see a feed of their posts the same way. No one can be outright banned or suspended, but each user can choose to block someone they don’t want to see.\n\nThe largest advantage to Nostr I see right now is that you can get paid in Sats (short for Satoshis, the smaller unit of a full Bitcoin) by other users. Post something funny or inspiring? Expect to get “zapped” (slang for receiving Sats). Just this week, someone who is pretty well liked on Nostr posted that they were having a bad week financially and needed some money to help their situation. Within a short time, they were sent enough Sats to help out. I’m sure they will return the favor when time allows it.\n\n![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-Wine-300x300.jpg)  \nThere’s even a pretty big growing group of wine lovers on Nostr made up of winemakers, industry professionals, and superfans like myself. We love to talk about what we’re drinking, give tips to others, start #winechain chains, and even drool over winery pictures from winemaker Ben Justman at [Peony Lane Wine](https://www.peonylanewine.com/) out of Colorado. He plans to release a special Bitcoin theme run of wines in the near future. Hopefully I’ll be able to include them in my next [Bitcoin and wine related article](https://www.sonofvin.com/2021/06/20/bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-and-the-future-of-wine/). One of the largest and best paid relays currently available is even named after wine, [Nostr.wine](https://nostr-wine.github.io/filter-relay/).\n\nWith Nostr’s ability to create direct messages, private channels, and even relays that theoretically only members of a private businesses could use to share internal messages between users, this could serve any industry looking for a free communication platform to conduct business without breaking the bank on monthly fees. Payment invoices can be directly handled from the Lightning Network, an integral part of the fast growing Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nostr-wine-3.jpg)  \nNostr, as a protocol, has a much broader and brighter future as ideas continue to be fleshed out weekly. It’s truly marvelous to watch how far it has come in just a few short months. Considering there wasn’t even a public iOS app for it until a month or so ago. Its developers are all working independently, solving bounties on an open source project, and are coming together to put an end to controlled and centralized platforms.\n\nSome savvy software engineers have already setup bots that play chess with you or offer hourly lottery drawings. Some bots merely zap people randomly every few minutes after they’ve made new posts. I’m even currently building a bot to zap people myself!\n\nRight now, using Nostr can be a bit tricky for those not very technically inclined. Hopefully a solution will be created soon to make it a bit easier for people to switch over. Everyone I know so far that has tried it is amazed and loves the freedom it gives. Most of the users are very welcoming and love debating tough topics with each other. And if you don’t like someone? Block them!\n\nI’ve been around the Internet since its early days and haven’t seen such a major shift like this since those first sets of online chatrooms were being created. Which funny enough, I had a major part in. As a teenager, I created one of the earliest and most successful Internet based chatroom systems with thousands of rooms used around the globe. But it was ultimately centralized and I watched as the person I built it for slowly destroyed it so I had to move on.\n\nI’m glad to see something new get created that won’t have that problem. It’s highly possible that as more people are able to join the Nostr community, the word will spread and people will wonder why they ever dealt with the way these companies had been treating them all along.\n\n_I wrote this while having a nice tall glass of Syrah. Rant over. Cheers!_\n\nIf you plan to join the Nostr world, [look me up](https://snort.social/p/npub1gjd56m6gw0kr4hdpx5z74fvv4tsmzpgcdwj8s47qx6g2u6wt0vjsu6a0tp)!\n\n[![](https://www.sonofvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Son_Of_Vin_Nostr-300x300.jpg)](https://snort.social/p/npub1gjd56m6gw0kr4hdpx5z74fvv4tsmzpgcdwj8s47qx6g2u6wt0vjsu6a0tp)\n\n**UPDATE:** After this article, I completed building 2 trivia bots for Nostr.\n\n[Trivia Masters](https://snort.social/p/npub1xcfdvc9whp285aqfn7yjf70e9c53nafzr5a2lr8vkeu4a0g075yq7j8tua) automatically posts general trivia questions every so often.

Though everyone dreams of something going wildly successful, I was happy that I had accomplished my original goal, learning something new.\nJust a small side note before we move on: I’ve worked as a software engineer with paying customers since 1996 and have seen so many technologies and computer languages come and go over the years. There have been plenty of them claiming to be game changers and the next popular thing all coders must learn in order to stay relevant and employable. It can get rather draining and tedious to learn new techniques and discard old bad habits every few years. Some of it is relatable to what you’ve learned before, though every so often something is so new and unique it takes much more focus to truly understand. The worst is when these new trending techs never reach their true potential and can make you feel like you’ve wasted too much time on something that will no longer be used. It’s a risk we all have to take though, as our options are either 1) not try to learn these new things and risk eventually becoming obsolete or 2) spend too much time on something that fades away and then you also risk becoming obsolete.\nWhen I was young, single, and full of curiosity, it was certainly much easier to keep up with all of this. Now that I am older, a dad, and with much less time on my hands, I simply can’t keep up with it nor do I want to. The rate of new technologies coming out is now even much faster than before, so it’s damn near impossible to truly keep up with everything anyway. Which means we risk even more by choosing or not choosing. With the launch of AIs like ChatGPT and Bard, I think things have just advanced to a new level, maybe even a different game entirely. New jobs and industries were created overnight for AI content writers, artists, and more. \nSo, anyway, after I launched my Wine Buddies NFT collection on OpenSea, I created a Twitter account specifically for the collection as it was by far the biggest used platform for NFT collectors and was surprised at the reception I was receiving. Due to this initial buzz, I even had them ranked on Rarity Sniper, a popular website for NFT collectors, to see which of the Wine Buddies were the most unique. All of this fell in line with what everyone else was doing with their collections, so I figured “why not”. Not too long after this my calendar was quickly being filled up as I was being invited to speak on Twitter Spaces about my collection both to the wine and NFT communities. \n\nThen suddenly, one day Wine Buddies’ Twitter account was suspended without any explanation and all of those Spaces I was supposed to attend were now unreachable. All I ever posted about was wine and the Wine Buddies NFT collection itself. No politics, hate, etc. As a web developer, I knew they had an API for us to test and work with in order to help automate our activities. As a one man team, this made me curious what they offered and how it could help me. I had worked with it in the past for clients, but it had been a while. I had spent one morning testing out their API and what their documentation showed we could do with it. Only a few hours later my account was suspended. My best guess was that something (that their own documentation explained how to do!) triggered this suspension. I never received a response from Twitter support as to why. Appeals went unanswered. No phone number to call, their own support account would never respond to direct messages. Months went by and my NFT project lost all of its momentum and over time NFTs in general lost their buzz.\nI never once received any emails from Twitter directly. Almost a year after this, I tried logging into that account and noticed bolded text saying it was now Permanently Suspended with just a link to their Terms of Service. Something on there TOS was what I had apparently broke and it was up to me to figure out exactly what. \nThe entire ordeal made me disheartened more than I had expected. This went from something I was doing for fun, to Wow, this is really taking off, to frustration, and ultimately sadness. It was all entirely out of my control and I should have known better. Social media companies are all businesses and ultimately they get to choose who uses them and they don’t have to explain why either. Free speech is not covered once you start using their business. We’re just the product (our data) that they sell to their advertisers. One tiny ant is meaningless to the greater hive mind. They also get to choose what content we see and who your own posts get to be seen by. Try creating a new account on many of those platforms now. It’s extremely hard to get seen by anyone unless you are already famous.\nIt really made me not want to use their service anymore (and frankly most of social media) and I nearly stopped using my main account afterwards. Still to this day, the Wine Buddies NFT account is permanently suspended. A few years before this incident, my personal Facebook account was also suspended for no reason. I rarely commented on anything and mostly just posted family pictures on my own timeline. I appealed and did eventually get that account back but never once received a reason why it even happened.\nAfter my WineBuddies NFT Twitter incident, I finally started looking into decentralized social media platforms. Decentralization in a nutshell means that no one person or organization has full control. Ultimately all of the individuals involved have a say in things. It’s true that a huge mass of people could band together to move the flow a certain way, but it still couldn’t be fully controlled. Decentralization has been slowly gaining attention across all multimedia platforms (video, social media, etc) but it wasn’t until Elon Musk bought Twitter that decentralized platforms like Mastodon and Nostr were suddenly gaining broader media attention due to the growing concern of censorship. Then late last year, former Twitter CEO and current Block CEO Jack Dorsey catapulted Nostr’s media attention by announcing a major donation to help push development forward faster.\n\nI did setup a Mastodon site for my film and music industry individuals to communicate, but I have personally landed on Nostr as my preferred decentralized censorship-free social media platform. Like Mastodon, Nostr uses relays to spread data around. Nostr which stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” has a purple ostrich as its mascot and is still heavy on the technical side to use, but so was the early days of the Internet. Users are often dubbed Nostriches, and posts are filled with jokes and memes no different than most other social media platforms, yet there is heavy tech talk focusing on building out the platform every week.\nThe way it is built, anyone can setup a website that lets users interact within the protocol. There is an ever growing list of dozens of web clients and other projects here. \nOne of its major differences from Mastodon, is that while Mastodon still requires email addresses and passwords to login, Nostr uses generated private and public keys for every user. So you don’t need to have an email address, you just need to keep your keys safe. There are some drawbacks to this idea though. Like if you lose your private key, you’re out of luck. No one can get it back for you. Or if someone gains access to where you are storing it and starts using it, then your account is compromised and you will need to create a new one. The positive to using generated keys is that it can be as anonymous as you wish and is entirely self controlled considering even your e-mail address or domain name providers can block your usage.\nAnyone can setup a relay if they are technically inclined enough, and they can allow anyone to post or read data from their relays. Ultimately your social global feed is an accumulation of posts from all of the relays you are attaching to. You can also follow people just like on other platforms and then just see a feed of their posts the same way. No one can be outright banned or suspended, but each user can choose to block someone they don’t want to see.\nThe largest advantage to Nostr I see right now is that you can get paid in Sats (short for Satoshis, the smaller unit of a full Bitcoin) by other users. Post something funny or inspiring? Expect to get “zapped” (slang for receiving Sats). Just this week, someone who is pretty well liked on Nostr posted that they were having a bad week financially and needed some money to help their situation. Within a short time, they were sent enough Sats to help out. I’m sure they will return the favor when time allows it.\n\nThere’s even a pretty big growing group of wine lovers on Nostr made up of winemakers, industry professionals, and superfans like myself. We love to talk about what we’re drinking, give tips to others, start #winechain chains, and even drool over winery pictures from winemaker Ben Justman at Peony Lane Wine out of Colorado. He plans to release a special Bitcoin theme run of wines in the near future. Hopefully I’ll be able to include them in my next Bitcoin and wine related article. One of the largest and best paid relays currently available is even named after wine, Nostr.wine.\nWith Nostr’s ability to create direct messages, private channels, and even relays that theoretically only members of a private businesses could use to share internal messages between users, this could serve any industry looking for a free communication platform to conduct business without breaking the bank on monthly fees. Payment invoices can be directly handled from the Lightning Network, an integral part of the fast growing Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nNostr, as a protocol, has a much broader and brighter future as ideas continue to be fleshed out weekly. It’s truly marvelous to watch how far it has come in just a few short months. Considering there wasn’t even a public iOS app for it until a month or so ago. Its developers are all working independently, solving bounties on an open source project, and are coming together to put an end to controlled and centralized platforms.\nSome savvy software engineers have already setup bots that play chess with you or offer hourly lottery drawings. Some bots merely zap people randomly every few minutes after they’ve made new posts. I’m even currently building a bot to zap people myself! \nRight now, using Nostr can be a bit tricky for those not very technically inclined. Hopefully a solution will be created soon to make it a bit easier for people to switch over. Everyone I know so far that has tried it is amazed and loves the freedom it gives. Most of the users are very welcoming and love debating tough topics with each other. And if you don’t like someone? Block them!\nI’ve been around the Internet since its early days and haven’t seen such a major shift like this since those first sets of online chatrooms were being created. Which funny enough, I had a major part in. As a teenager, I created one of the earliest and most successful Internet based chatroom systems with thousands of rooms used around the globe. But it was ultimately centralized and I watched as the person I built it for slowly destroyed it so I had to move on. \nI’m glad to see something new get created that won’t have that problem. It’s highly possible that as more people are able to join the Nostr community, the word will spread and people will wonder why they ever dealt with the way these companies had been treating them all along. \nI wrote this while having a nice tall glass of Syrah. Rant over. Cheers!\nIf you plan to join the Nostr world, look me up!\n\nUPDATE: After this article, I completed building 2 trivia bots for Nostr. \nTrivia Masters automatically posts general trivia questions every so often. The first to answer correctly wins sats. One other commenter will randomly be selected to win consolation sats as well. You can also force it to start a round by posting to the global feed “@TriviaMasters start trivia” .\nWine Masters was my original plan and is a wine trivia posting bot. It works exactly the same as above, but only posts wine related questions. Enough people were wanting general trivia so I built the other one too. You can force it to start another round of wine trivia by posting “@WineMasters start trivia”.\nSend a DM on Nostr if you like using my bots!\n                \n                            "],["length","13174"],["r","https://zapworthy.com/load?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofvin.com%2F2023%2F03%2F31%2Fnostr-wine-and-the-future-of-social-media-platforms%2F&author=npub1gjd56m6gw0kr4hdpx5z74fvv4tsmzpgcdwj8s47qx6g2u6wt0vjsu6a0tp"],["published_at","1681925078"]]}]"###)

After reading a few “How To” articles, I decided to give it a go and created my own goofy wine themed collection called [the Wine Buddies](https://winebuddies.io/) for the fun of it.

Like Mastodon, Nostr uses relays to spread data around. Nostr which stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” has a purple ostrich as its mascot and is still heavy on the technical side to use, but so was the early days of the Internet. Users are often dubbed Nostriches, and posts are filled with jokes and memes no different than most other social media platforms, yet there is heavy tech talk focusing on building out the platform every week.\nThe way it is built, anyone can setup a website that lets users interact within the protocol. There is an ever growing list of dozens of web clients and other projects here. \nOne of its major differences from Mastodon, is that while Mastodon still requires email addresses and passwords to login, Nostr uses generated private and public keys for every user. So you don’t need to have an email address, you just need to keep your keys safe. There are some drawbacks to this idea though. Like if you lose your private key, you’re out of luck. No one can get it back for you. Or if someone gains access to where you are storing it and starts using it, then your account is compromised and you will need to create a new one. The positive to using generated keys is that it can be as anonymous as you wish and is entirely self controlled considering even your e-mail address or domain name providers can block your usage.\nAnyone can setup a relay if they are technically inclined enough, and they can allow anyone to post or read data from their relays. Ultimately your social global feed is an accumulation of posts from all of the relays you are attaching to. You can also follow people just like on other platforms and then just see a feed of their posts the same way. No one can be outright banned or suspended, but each user can choose to block someone they don’t want to see.\nThe largest advantage to Nostr I see right now is that you can get paid in Sats (short for Satoshis, the smaller unit of a full Bitcoin) by other users. Post something funny or inspiring? Expect to get “zapped” (slang for receiving Sats). Just this week, someone who is pretty well liked on Nostr posted that they were having a bad week financially and needed some money to help their situation. Within a short time, they were sent enough Sats to help out. I’m sure they will return the favor when time allows it.\n\nThere’s even a pretty big growing group of wine lovers on Nostr made up of winemakers, industry professionals, and superfans like myself. We love to talk about what we’re drinking, give tips to others, start #winechain chains, and even drool over winery pictures from winemaker Ben Justman at Peony Lane Wine out of Colorado. He plans to release a special Bitcoin theme run of wines in the near future. Hopefully I’ll be able to include them in my next Bitcoin and wine related article. One of the largest and best paid relays currently available is even named after wine, Nostr.wine.\nWith Nostr’s ability to create direct messages, private channels, and even relays that theoretically only members of a private businesses could use to share internal messages between users, this could serve any industry looking for a free communication platform to conduct business without breaking the bank on monthly fees. Payment invoices can be directly handled from the Lightning Network, an integral part of the fast growing Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nNostr, as a protocol, has a much broader and brighter future as ideas continue to be fleshed out weekly. It’s truly marvelous to watch how far it has come in just a few short months. Considering there wasn’t even a public iOS app for it until a month or so ago. Its developers are all working independently, solving bounties on an open source project, and are coming together to put an end to controlled and centralized platforms.\nSome savvy software engineers have already setup bots that play chess with you or offer hourly lottery drawings. Some bots merely zap people randomly every few minutes after they’ve made new posts. I’m even currently building a bot to zap people myself! \nRight now, using Nostr can be a bit tricky for those not very technically inclined. Hopefully a solution will be created soon to make it a bit easier for people to switch over. Everyone I know so far that has tried it is amazed and loves the freedom it gives. Most of the users are very welcoming and love debating tough topics with each other. And if you don’t like someone? Block them!\nI’ve been around the Internet since its early days and haven’t seen such a major shift like this since those first sets of online chatrooms were being created. Which funny enough, I had a major part in. As a teenager, I created one of the earliest and most successful Internet based chatroom systems with thousands of rooms used around the globe. But it was ultimately centralized and I watched as the person I built it for slowly destroyed it so I had to move on. \nI’m glad to see something new get created that won’t have that problem. It’s highly possible that as more people are able to join the Nostr community, the word will spread and people will wonder why they ever dealt with the way these companies had been treating them all along. \nI wrote this while having a nice tall glass of Syrah. Rant over. Cheers!\nIf you plan to join the Nostr world, look me up!\n\n                \n                            "],["length","12446"],["r","https://zapworthy.com/load?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofvin.com%2F2023%2F03%2F31%2Fnostr-wine-and-the-future-of-social-media-platforms%2F&author=npub1gjd56m6gw0kr4hdpx5z74fvv4tsmzpgcdwj8s47qx6g2u6wt0vjsu6a0tp"],["published_at","1681925038"]]}]"###)

And certainly it hasn't been proven that the mystical experience is necessary for the effect.  But if he had ever done mushrooms himself I think he would have a different opinion.  He admits that depression comes from a feeling of hopelessness. Why can't he see that a mystical awakening would logically dissapate feelings of hopelessness? Not proven, but based on my personal experience I think it is very likely that the mystical experience is the core reason for the cure.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VveicvY5yF4","id":"0000014de66e08882bd36b6b7b551a774f85fe752a18070dc8658d7776db7e69","created_at":1681073555,"sig":"ba5f5ae440125db99f7442ea345da0fce321bdc316af21ddb6daa6a2ecd05fc8e2c0d1f60d9a259b6c058a9d88b138146f216680d3ed28a9c16a4cbbfaea8c65","kind":1,"tags":[["client","gossip"],["nonce","7686143364045655093","20"]]}]"###)

Unfortunately, it won't work for me personally... Twitter Developer Account is a showstopper for most people. I get 403 Forbiddens when requesting a token, and relying on Twitter's API after the last couple weeks in general is kinda 😥, even though it's clearly the least jank solution. \n\nWould be easier to pull Twitter -> Nostr than Nostr -> Twitter. The same flow really applies for any social network site, since they're all closed and hostile. Would be nice to have a single onboarding tool for Nostr that basically runs snscrape/checks rss/whatever against your Twitter/FB/Instagram/Tiktok, and unjails the user's content by re-posting over here. Could even schedule it to pull updates for X period.\n\nI think it would help a lot of folks ease the transition to Nostr if we could make tell them \"it's not Twitter, Instagram, or Tiktok: it's *all* of them. MOVE YOUR POSTS WITH ONE TRICK DOCTORS HATE.\" \n\nMirroring an open site to populate a closed one feels to me a bit like taking artwork from a museum to decorate a dumpster. Rescuing something from the dumpster to display in the museum feels a little more like a public service.\n\nIf somebody does it, them should do it under nym, rather than true name, imo, to preempt harrassment.\n\nBut I'm just thinking out loud.","tags":[["e","ccf340dd6564171a1cbe1a7b5a6b4994b471964b6103cd78639edaa0d90fc1a2","wss://jiggytom.ddns.net","reply"],["p","e2ccf7cf20403f3f2a4a55b328f0de3be38558a7d5f33632fdaaefc726c1c8eb"],["p","84dee6e676e5bb67b4ad4e042cf70cbd8681155db535942fcc6a0533858a7240"]],"sig":"4e938e20ec4f42de95cf0c629169cdf9b2e510c5a89292c1bf00f0f91403fb51aba59b5b458bf0392cf0d3f3106a4af172a804e859cb1f02b1139a195c803e34"}]"###)

I'd say a standard \"reasonably private without being a pain\" setup would be to connect to Nostr through the Tor Browser (included by default) running on the Whonix VM images. The Tor Browser by itself is probably enough for most people, but Whonix layer helps prevent network leaks in the event of malware or a misbehaving app, for those for whom those are relevant concerns.\n\nSnort.social isn't (yet) working on Tor (without disabling private browsing mode), but I think they have a pull request up on their git, so hopefully soon. I only mentioned it because I saw it during testing and liked the UX. I'm using iris.to right now through the TBB, and it works fine. Only thing I've noticed missing is the NIP-05 profile field. \n\nI don't really *need* a nip05 yet, because my key has a memorable prefix that's not (yet) trivially brutable. Will add one eventually -- and FWIW I really appreciate the offers from everybody who already reached out to help on that. \n\nRealistically, I think 90% of potential users won't becoming from desktop clients, they'll be coming from mobile, so I think the real key is to build mobile apps that have a checkbox to route their traffic through the local tor instance.

Current version of Alby improperly depends on localdb storage in the browser, which can't (shouldn't) be enabled in the Tor Browser because it opens vulnerabilities. I actually wouldn't be Alby because of this, but I found a (terrible, painful, not recommended) workaround that let me limp along.\n\nMany nostr webapps fail entirely in the Tor Browser due to missing exception handling for when localdb writes fail -- like snort.social -- and others initially appear to load but then don't function when you click buttons that write to localdb. Credit to snort.social, because I think they're actually looking at doing a patch to fix it, which is nice because I'd like to try it. Other webapps do work just fine (e.g. https://iris.to, which I'm using right now in the Tor Browser), because either they've written in fallbacks for when localdb is unavailable, or are written to avoid the problem, or... I don't actually know, but somehow they work.\n\nFor browser extensions like Alby, nos2x (on github) is an open source example that works fine. Please look at how they implemented it and push an Alby update. Because anybody privacy-conscious enough to use Nostr is probably privacy-conscious enough to be tempted by the Tor Browser, and in the long term, if people like me have to choose between Alby and Tor, Tor comes first.\n\nBest regards.","tags":[["e","4cd665db042864ee600ee976d6cfcc7c5ce743859462f94a347cd970d88a5f3b","wss://jiggytom.ddns.net","reply"],["p","330fb1431ff9d8c250706bbcdc016d5495a3f744e047a408173e92ae7ee42dac"]],"sig":"a4e8d6be854d84e9dc4070997efef1b3df700e923da0f9a9c81f317c4ce69dc140354b5075f15ca504f9860d0109cfa0d831f34b8e1695391a60f1e4f3e44cf6"}]"###)

It’s all a conflict of interest.\n\nThose that actually listen to your show quickly hear nearly every guest and you talk about not shitcoining and “not your keys not your coins”. In less than a year I went from being a shitcoiner to Bitcoin maxi. Almost all rabbit holes I went down came from something your show talked about or guests you had on. My point here is keep doing what you are doing AND I encourage you (just as Matt did) to improve further. Check out value for value. Where is your Patreon and how can I help pay for the show to reduce need for fiat advertisements?

Each epoch that has come before it is laid on top of it in reverse order such that the first epoch is always the foremost layer.\n\nHere's a look at Epoch 1, with no prior epochs:\n\nhttps://nostr.build/i/nostr.build_dc23408ee9e2606a666bb57db551da08ff2d5dd222bc1691f213b58f652685f3.jpg\n\nEach epoch other than the title epoch in white is colored and etched according to the preferences of the owner of the previous piece in the series.\n\nThere is no owner of Epoch 1, so I chose Satoshi's Genesis Block quote in orange.\n\nHere's a look at Epoch 2 with updated epoch 1:\n\nhttps://nostr.build/i/nostr.build_eb5bbed0ea1a711e66ed7b1935ca9909c3caa7e88d16dd5549555144e5bfcdd6.jpg\n\nAfter each halving, the owner of the most recent artwork in the series may collaborate on the next artwork to choose the color and etching for the epoch represented by the artwork they own, allowing owners of the art to influence the design of all future works in the series.\n\nSince I am retaining ownership of Epoch 2, I chose my personal logo and greens (of course) for the etching and color for epoch 2 in the Epoch 3 and all future artworks in the series.\nHere is another look at Epoch 3:\n\nhttps://nostr.build/i/nostr.build_c682b3ffc6096f2244de96e366d804498ab4375335418c0d447e744dc7624936.jpg\n\nThe epochs and related designs that have been established thus far are:\n\nEpoch 1: Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin Genesis block quote, in white on orange.\n\nEpoch 2: Dustin D. Trammell, Personal Logo, in light greens on dark green.\n\nWho will own and choose the design for Epoch 3?  You?\n\nEach piece is framed with built-in framing in black with a gray backing behind the artwork.  The name of the piece and artist signature with production year are etched in white directly into the frame.\n\nhttps://nostr.build/i/nostr.build_4f4015360db04acf3e4ef7a5872e85d6b2a05e1b50e8210717643bdd45206a95.jpg\n\nAll artworks are laser cut with help from #[0] out of Baltic Birch wood and finished with acrylic paint.

There is no necromancy or joining of the dark side involved, and it has nothing to do with whether \"THE ALGORITHM\" is “good” or “bad.” The very idea of “not having an algorithm,” just means you want the algorithm to list the posts of who you follow in chronological order.  It in no way means you are “algorithm free,” it just means that the rules of your feed are \"take only the posts from the people I follow and order them chronologically,\" and that’s basically it.\n\nEverything about the concept of a social network and the incredible potential and beauty of #nostr as a protocol is in controlling your experience, what content you see, and how you see it. This is literally the entire point of having follows, followers, and reposts in the first place. It's at the core of the very notion of what social media is. This is literally “an algorithm” in the same way as prioritizing new posts over old would be, or limiting those who post more, or amplifying those who post less in your feed. They are exactly the same kind of rules, they are different only in specificity.\n\nSo what’s the problem with “THE ALGORITHM” then? It’s nothing to do with some vague notion of an “unnatural” feed or whatever it might seem like since we seem to have developed this distaste for the very concept. The problem is purely that **someone else** has been specifically manipulating your feed *against your best interests.*\n\nIt’s the same issue as censorship. My blocking a dickhead who won’t shut up about their shitcoin or who squeals at me under every single post with demands to read some communist propaganda on my podcast, isn’t censorship, it’s me choosing who I interact with. Censorship is when an external participant, someone not involved in the conversation at all, decides that I should not see some idea or should not communicate with some person *despite my explicit desire to do so,* and is able to remove my access from it without my permission.\n\nThe same goes for “THE ALGORITHM.” It’s not a problem if I’m controlling it for my own feed, this is a basic and fundamental tool of digital filtering that absolutely must be embraced, not feared or run away from, because it’ll make a huge difference in the user experience. It’s simply that someone else shouldn’t be controlling it to be at odds with the content and experience that the user specifically wants and is trying to create. Only THEN it is a very bad \"algorithm\" and a dangerous relationship.\n\nThe problem with all of these things has nothing to do with what they actually are, its about who has control.\n\nThe user is always supposed to be in control of who they follow, the content and ideas they want to see, and the people they want to associate with. Only then is it truly a free market and open space guided and created by its users. The problem has always been about central points of control forcing information asymmetries that aren't real, censoring ideas that are beneficial to you and inconvenient to them, etc. \n\nI always like to try to analogize these sorts of things to the IRL world to understand what makes them bad and why a good one is actually incredible important. In the real world, if you go to a party and decide to converse with your friend, while ignoring all others you are weighing their interaction higher than the others at the party. If you decide to play a game of beer pong with your friend, you are creating a very specific set of rules by which your interaction will fall into. Not because you enjoy the evils of \"THE ALGORITHM,\" but because you want to get drunk and have a lot of fun. Censorship would be if some external govt or other party was able to mute your conversation from thousands of miles away, while you were standing in front of your friend talking to them. THEY interrupted your conversation and shut off your communication channel despite both of you explicitly agreeing to the interaction. Or you were having a conversation with your friend and the second they began telling you about how your mutual acquaintence in in the hospital with myocarditis, they vanish from the party and a person you don't even know immediately walks up to explain to you how safe and effective the Pfizer products are. \n\nAn IRL \"evil algorithm\" would be this external institution or person making a particular group at the party invisible to you without your knowledge, it would be forcing a beer pong table in front of you no matter where you went or what else you wanted to do. Constantly enticing you to get drunk and play a game you were doing everything to avoid. Even adding arbitrary obstacles to all other activities and dropping NLP messaging of \"drink up\" and \"solo cup\" into all of your conversations without your knowledge. As crazy as it sounds, this is essentially the norm. This is how our online environment has evolved. So it makes sense that when we broke free of that, we would have a horrible taste in our mouths for the very idea of \"THE ALGORITHM.\" It certainly isn't irrational, despite being misplaced.\n\nBeing part of the digital world is a weird thing when comparing it to real life. There is never a situation in meatspace where one has to filter how they will talk to a million people all at once. The very notion is comically absurd. But this IS a consideration in the digital world. Its like being dropped into a seemingly unlimited ocean of content and people, which is to the individual, genuinely infinite, as more content and interactions are being added to it by the minute so fast that it would take a lifetime to even manually sort through it all. Blocking, filtering, information rules, value weights and yes, \"THE ALGORITHM\" aren't things that are nice to have, these things are critical, inescapable tools for navigating the endless ocean of the digital world. These are not things to be afraid of or label broadly as \"evil\" and avoided at all costs. To the contrary, they are basic pieces of the puzzle that I think we need to understand. We need to put them in the hands of the user, so we can do incredible things with them.\n\nThe one core concern, is quite simple: How do we enable *the user* to set the rules, and not a third party? In my opinion, this is all that distinguishes the ultimately good from the bad.\n\nWe must remember not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Creating \"THE ALGORITHM\" is not accepting an invitation from Darth Vader to join the dark side. It's just a means of curating your feed so you get the best experience you can, and you find the content, ideas, and community that you came to #nostr looking for.\n\nWhen we realize the importance of custom controls and modes of interaction, then we realize what all of these clients really are. Every one of them is really just a different \"algorithm\" that the user can select from. One that shows only images, one that filters everything but a certain community or topic, one that organizes based on most zapped, or by the number of likes specifically from those in your network, and on and on. The potential of #nostr isn't an algorithm-free experience, it's in an ecosystem with an unlimited number of experiences to choose from so that each person can either choose or build the community that they want, in a global square with no rulers. \n\nAn important step to getting to the future we want is to understand, with specificity and nuance, the exact sources of the problems we are trying to fix, rather than painting broad strokes and just carrying around a bunch of baggage about a tool we should be using for ourselves. The promise of nostr, and Bitcoin, and so many other tools we are building on and embracing is to create at the communication layer, a foundation of freedom that can be accessed by every single user no matter where they are in the world.\n\nSo in short, there is no such thing as \"THE ALGORITHM.\" The problem has always been about who has control over your digital world? Is it you, or is it someone else? In the fight to prevent that control from finding its way back into the hands of someone else, it would be foolish to let our PTSD over the past have us avoid the very tools that would let us build a future specifically tuned to give us the very value and and autonomy that we all seek.

More than a third of all subreddits remain private, according to the tracker Reddark (https://reddark.untone.uk/), and some moderators say they intend to keep up the disruption until Reddit walks back its announced changes.\n\nWhile the situation remains too fluid to undertake a full postmortem, today let’s talk about what we’ve learned from Reddit’s standoff with its user base so far. Reddit was early to the idea that successful social products work to transfer power to their users — but the site’s woes this month suggest that relying too much on the user base to maintain the service may make them question what they ever needed the platform for, anyway.\n\n1. **Devolving power to users can come back to haunt a platform …**\n\n\nOf all the content moderation regimes set up by social platforms over the past two decades, Reddit’s might well have been the best. The site sets a “floor” of rules that every forum must meet — no terrorism, no child exploitation — but lets any individual subreddit raise the “ceiling” with rules of its own. If a religious forum wants to ban cursing, it’s welcome to. If an NSFW forum wants to ban images of people with their clothes on, that’s fair game, too.\n\nWhile Facebook and Twitter attempted to govern vast global audiences with a one-size-fits-all set of rules, Reddit’s approach brought context and community to its niche forums. Making it work, though, required an army of volunteer moderators to set up and enforce their subreddits’ particular rules. As we’ve seen over the past week, collectively those moderators wield real power: traffic dropped an estimated 6.6 percent last week (https://www.engadget.com/reddits-average-daily-traffic-fell-during-blackout-according-to-third-party-data-194721801.html) as subreddits went dark, according to one estimate. And because they set the rules, it was up to the moderators whether or when the subreddits would ever come back online.\n\nThis power dynamic seemed to infuriate CEO Steve Huffman, who referred to moderators over the weekend as a “landed gentry (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-protest-blackout-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-rcna89544)” who lack accountability to their constituents. Huffman told NBC’s David Ingram that he is considering making changes to Reddit’s rules that would let users vote out moderators more easily over unpopular decisions — like taking a subreddit private, for example.\n\n“If you’re a politician or a business owner, you are accountable to your constituents. So a politician needs to be elected, and a business owner can be fired by its shareholders,” Huffman told Ingram.  “And I think, on Reddit, the analogy is closer to the landed gentry: The people who get there first get to stay there and pass it down to their descendants, and that is not democratic.”\n\nReddit could have (https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762792/reddit-subreddit-closed-unilaterally-reopen-communities), but so far has not, simply overridden moderators’ decisions and turned all the dark subreddits public again. Instead, the company wrote to moderators suggesting that it would remove them if they did not make their forums public again (https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763538/reddit-blackout-api-protest-mod-replacement-threat).\n\nOn the whole, Reddit has benefited from a system that largely spares its leaders from having to make impossible decisions over what kinds of speech belong on the platform. But it also makes the company unusually vulnerable when, in an effort to wrest back some power from the user base, they revolt.\n\n1. **… But devolving power to the user base is still probably the future of social networks.**\n\n\nRedditors are mad that, due to a huge spike in the price of Reddit’s API, the third-party clients they currently rely on for browsing, moderation, and accessibility may now disappear. They had come to expect that Reddit’s decentralized approach to governing the site would always extend to the way that it managed development of the site itself. (In fairness to them, Reddit executives certainly talk about it that way (https://www.fastcompany.com/90876355/reddit-nft-collectible-avatars).)\n\nReddit’s rationale is straightforward: to cut costs and make its ad business profitable, it needs to push users toward its native app and website, where users can be monetized more easily. The decentralized ethos has begun to give way toward a more conventional walled-garden approach.\n\nIn doing so, though, Reddit may be swimming against the tide. Increasingly, next-generation social networks are starting from the idea that they ought to be governed from the bottom up. Led by Mastodon, and followed more recently by Bluesky (https://www.platformer.news/p/blueskys-big-moment) and Meta’s forthcoming Threads (https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub), newer networks are moving way from the walled-garden model toward something looser and less formal.\n\nOf course, none of those apps are yet profitable. Nor have they even really hit a critical mass of users. But it’s clear that the era of free APIs has given way to the era of free development protocols. And to the extent that these services can enable vibrant, self-governed communities and development ecosystems of their own, they may make Reddit’s more halfhearted attempt at decentralization look outdated.\n\n1. **Mainly this whole Reddit thing has been a communications disaster**.\n\n\nHow much would the new API cost? When would it take effect? Which kinds of apps using the API would be affected?\n\nThese are among the questions Reddit had no answers for when it announced its forthcoming changes in April (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html). That led to weeks of confusion as everyone affected tried to figure out what all this meant for them.\n\nThese days, platforms rarely make major changes without accompanying the announcement with answers to all the most obvious questions. Reddit didn’t, and paid the price. I’m not sure if the company thought that positioning its move as a defense against large language models (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html) would inoculate it from criticism, but if so it clearly thought wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, Huffman’s interviews over the weekend, while admirable for their candor, also heightened the perception that the company is at war with its own user base.\n\nUsually when platforms upset their users, good communications can only help at the margins. In this case, though, truly terrible communications took what could have been an orderly transition and turned it into a crisis.\n\n1. **CEOs really are taking cues from Elon Musk**.\n\n\nIf you’re wondering how all this shakes out for Reddit as business, it’s worth noting that Huffman says he is impressed with Twitter 2.0 (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-protest-blackout-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-rcna89544):\n\n> “As a company smaller than theirs, sub-$1 billion in revenue, I used to look at Twitter and say, ‘Well, why can’t they break even at 4 or 5 billion in revenue? What about their business do we not understand?’ Because I think we should be able to do that quite handsomely,” he said.\n>\n> “And then I think one of the nonobvious things that Elon showed is what I was hoping would be true, which is: You can run a company with that many users in the ads business and break even with a lot fewer people,” Huffman said.\n\nWe wrote in November that lots of tech CEOs were impressed with Musk’s brutal cost-cutting (https://www.platformer.news/p/why-some-tech-ceos-are-rooting-for), and now here’s one of them saying that on the record. (Mark Zuckerberg said something similar to Lex Fridman this month (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ), though in fairness Fridman has asked him to say something nice about the Twitter CEO.)\n\nAnyway, I mention all this because Twitter is absolutely not “breaking even.” As William Cohan wrote in _Puck_ over the weekend, Musk has already vaporized tens of billions of dollars in value, and is likely cruising toward a takeover by his creditors (https://puck.news/will-elon-lose-control-of-twitter/). If your CEO observes this and holds it up as a model for your company, I’d worry.\n\n1. **Redditors do have other options.**\n\n\nIn the past few days, decentralized alternatives to Twitter picked up around 70,000 users over more than 1,000 instances, according to this blog post on the subject (https://privacy.thenexus.today/8-days-later-draft-kbin-lemmy-landed-gentry/). That’s quite small compared to Reddit, of course. But it does at least raise the question of what Reddit users actually need _Reddit_ for.\n\nThe value of the site lies almost entirely in the people posting there. This is not a company that makes fun creative tools, hypnotic ranking algorithms, or pixel-polished designs. Instead, it aggregates a lot of eyeballs and lets the owners of those eyeballs run their own forums.\n\nThis, then, becomes another way the company is beholden to its users. Because the company offers the average user little more than basic infrastructure, it creates an opportunity for users to seek alternative infrastructure elsewhere. Networks can and do move over time. (Which is the actual lesson Huffman should be taking from Musk’s Twitter.)\n\nThat leads me to the one question I have about all this. It’s clear that events of the past couple months have hurt Reddit’s trust with its user base (https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-reddit-protests-are-winding-down-so-whats-next/). But how much will that matter in the end?\n\nHuffman’s argument is that this whole protest is a tempest in a teapot — the actions of a few unruly moderators who do not represent the user base at large. If that’s the case, perhaps he can be confident that the whole thing will blow over soon. It does seem telling that, so far at least, Reddit employees seem to be taking Huffman’s side. (As Alex Heath reported on Friday (https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763644/command-line-a-vibe-check-inside-reddit).)\n\nOn the other hand — more than a third of subreddits are still dark! Alternative sites are now in active development. And the fracture that opened up in social networks when Musk bought Twitter is continuing to spread. Ever-shifting platform rules are leading more people to look for places they can govern themselves.\n\nAnd few people will be better at that than the ones who have spent the past 18 years moderating Reddit.\n\n* * *\n\nLovett or Leave It\n\nBay Area!

If you’ve stumbled upon this post, but don’t have a Nostr “account” yet, you can follow [this simple step-by-step guide](https://worldtravelambitions.notion.site/worldtravelambitions/How-to-Set-Up-Nostr-Using-GetAlby-and-Snort-social-c3fabb2ecc8d465dba0e73a3f1c2558a) bydd nostr:npub1cly0v30agkcfq40mdsndzjrn0tt76ykaan0q6ny80wy034qedpjsqwamhz -- `java npub1cly0v30agkcfq40mdsndzjrn0tt76ykaan0q6ny80wy034qedpjsqwamhz java`.\n\n---\n\n## 🤙 Have fun\n\nNostr is built to ensure people can connect, get heard, and have fun along the way. This is the whole point (obviously, there is a plethora of serious use cases, such as being a tool for freedom fighters and whistleblowers, but that deserves a separate article), so if you feel like anything feels burdensome, please reach out to the more experienced nostriches and we will be happy to help. Interacting with Nostr is not hard at all, but it has a few peculiarities when compared to traditional platforms, so it’s ok (and encouraged) to ask questions. \n\nHere’s an _unofficial_ list of Nostr ambassadors who will be happy to help you get onboard:\n\nnostr:naddr1qqg5ummnw3ezqstdvfshxumpv3hhyuczypl4c26wfzswnlk2vwjxky7dhqjgnaqzqwvdvz3qwz5k3j4grrt46qcyqqq82vgwv96yu\n\n_All the nostriches on the list were also awarded a [Nostr Ambassador](https://lnshort.it/nostr-ambassadors) badge that will make it easy for you to find, verify and follow them_\n\n---\n\n## ⚡️ Enable Zaps\n\nZaps are one of the first differences one may notice after joining Nostr. They allow Nostr users to instantly send value and support creation of useful and fun content. This is possible thanks to Bitcoin and Lightning Network. These decentralized payment protocols let you instantly send some sats (the smallest unit on the Bitcoin network) just as easily as liking someone’s post on traditional social media platforms. We call this model Value-4-Value and you can find more about this ultimate monetization model here: [https://dergigi.com/value/](https://dergigi.com/value/) \n\nCheck out [this note](https://lnshort.it/what-are-zaps/) by nostr:npub18ams6ewn5aj2n3wt2qawzglx9mr4nzksxhvrdc4gzrecw7n5tvjqctp424 that is a great intro to what zaps are.\n\nYou should enable Zaps even if you do not consider yourself a content creator – people **will** find some of your notes valuable and might want to send you some sats. The easiest way to start receiving value on Nostr onley takes a couple steps:\n\n**0** Download [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) [^1] (probably the best choice for those who are new to Bitcoin and Lightning) for your mobile device [^2]\n**1** Tap “Receive”\n**2** Tap the Lightning Address you see on the screen (the string which looks like an email address) to copy it to the clipboard.\n![wos2](https://nostr.build/p/nb5751.png)\n**3** Paste the copied address into the corresponding field in your Nostr client (the field may say “Bitcoin Lightning Address”, “LN Address” or anything along those lines depending on the app you are using). \n![paste](https://nostr.build/p/nb5752.png)\n\n---\n\n## 📫 Get a Nostr address\n\nNostr address, often referred to as a “NIP-05 identifier” by the Nostr OGs, looks like an email and: \n\n🔍 Helps you make your account easy to discover and share \n✔️ Serves as a verification you are a human\n\n---\n\nHere's an example of a Nostr address: [Tony@nostr.21ideas.org](nostr:npub10awzknjg5r5lajnr53438ndcyjylgqsrnrtq5grs495v42qc6awsj45ys7)\n![nip-05](https://nostr.build/p/nb5756.png)\n _It's easy to memorize and later paste into any Nostr app to find the corresponding user._\n\n---\n\nTo get a Nostr address you can use a free service like [Nostr Check](https://nostrcheck.me/) (by nostr:npub138s5hey76qrnm2pmv7p8nnffhfddsm8sqzm285dyc0wy4f8a6qkqtzx624) or a paid one like [Nostr Plebs](https://nostrplebs.com/) (by nostr:npub18ams6ewn5aj2n3wt2qawzglx9mr4nzksxhvrdc4gzrecw7n5tvjqctp424). Both offer different perks, and it's up to you to decide which one to use. Another way of getting a Nostr address is using a browser extension. Find out more about this approach [here](https://blog.getalby.com/the-2-minute-alby-guide-to-nostr/)) .   \n\n---\n\n## 🙇‍♀️ Learn the basics\n\nUnder the hood Nostr is very different from traditional social platforms, so getting a basic understanding of what it is about will be beneficial for any newcomer. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not suggesting you should learn a programming language or technical details of the protocol. I’m implying that seeing a bigger picture and understanding the difference between Nostr and Twitter / Medium / Reddit will help a lot. For example, there are no passwords and logins, you have private and public keys instead. I won’t go deep into that, ‘cause there is a handful of exhaustive resources that will help you grokk Nostr. All of the ones worthy your attention are gathered [on this neatly organized landing page](https://www.bevstr.com/Nostr/) prepared by nostr:npub12gu8c6uee3p243gez6cgk76362admlqe72aq3kp2fppjsjwmm7eqj9fle6 with 💜\n\n![bevstr](https://nostr.build/p/nb5847.png)\n_Info provided by the mentioned resources will also help you secure your Nostr keys (i.e. your account), so it’s important to have a look._\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 Connect\n\nAbility to connect with brilliant [^3] people is what makes Nostr special. Here everyone can get heard and no one can get excluded. There are a few simple ways to find interesting people on Nostr:\n\n* **Find people you follow on Twitter**: [**https://www.nostr.directory/**](https://www.nostr.directory/) is a great tool for that.\n* **Follow people followed by people you trust**: Visit a profile of a person who shares your interests, check the list of people they follow and connect with them.\n\n![gigi](https://nostr.build/p/nb5377.png)\n\n* **Visit Global Feed**: Every Nostr client (a Nostr app, if you will) has a tab that lets you switch to the Global Feed, which aggregates all the notes from all Nostr users. Simply follow people you find interesting (be patient though – you might run into a decent amount of spam).\n\n![global](https://nostr.build/p/nb5376.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🗺️ Explore\n\nThe mentioned 5 steps are a great start that will massively improve your experience, but there’s so much more to discover and enjoy! Nostr is not a Twitter replacement, its possibilities are only limited by imagination. \n\n![nostr-apps](https://nostr.build/p/nb5848.png)\n\nHave a look at the list of fun and useful Nostr projects:\n\n* [**https://nostrapps.com/**](https://www.nostrapps.com/) a list of Nostr apps\n* [**https://nostrplebs.com/**](https://nostrplebs.com/) – get your NIP-05 and other Nostr perks (paid)\n* [**https://nostrcheck.me/**](https://nostrcheck.me/) – Nostr address, media uploads, relay \n* [**https://nostr.build/**](https://nostr.build/) – upload and manage media (and more)\n* [**https://nostr.band/**](https://nostr.band/) – Nostr network and user info\n* [**https://zaplife.lol/**](https://zaplife.lol/) – zapping stats\n* [**https://nostrit.com/**](https://nostrit.com/) – schedule notes \n* [**https://nostrnests.com/**](https://nostrnests.com/) – Twitter Spaces 2.0  \n* [**https://nostryfied.online/**](https://nostryfied.online/) - back up your Nostr info\n* [**https://www.wavman.app/**](https://www.wavman.app/) - Nostr music player\n\n---\n\n## 📻 Relays\n\nAfter getting acquainted with Nostr make sure to check out my quick guide on Nostr relays: [https://lnshort.it/nostr-relays](https://lnshort.it/nostr-relays).

            ###"["EVENT","WHAT",{"content":"There’s a lot of conversation around the #TwitterFiles. Here’s my take, and thoughts on how to fix the issues identified.\n\nI’ll start with the principles I’ve come to believe…based on everything I’ve learned and experienced through my past actions as a Twitter co-founder and lead:\n\n1. Social media must be resilient to corporate and government control.\n2. Only the original author may remove content they produce.\n3. Moderation is best implemented by algorithmic choice.\n\nThe Twitter when I led it and the Twitter of today do not meet any of these principles. This is my fault alone, as I completely gave up pushing for them when an activist entered our stock in 2020. I no longer had hope of achieving any of it as a public company with no defense mechanisms (lack of dual-class shares being a key one). I planned my exit at that moment knowing I was no longer right for the company.\n\nThe biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation, versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves. This burdened the company with too much power, and opened us to significant outside pressure (such as advertising budgets). I generally think companies have become far too powerful, and that became completely clear to me with our suspension of Trump’s account. As I’ve said before, we did the right thing for the public company business at the time, but the wrong thing for the internet and society. Much more about this here: https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690\n\nI continue to believe there was no ill intent or hidden agendas, and everyone acted according to the best information we had at the time. Of course mistakes were made. But if we had focused more on tools for the people using the service rather than tools for us, and moved much faster towards absolute transparency, we probably wouldn’t be in this situation of needing a fresh reset (which I am supportive of). Again, I own all of this and our actions, and all I can do is work to make it right.\n\nBack to the principles. Of course governments want to shape and control the public conversation, and will use every method at their disposal to do so, including the media. And the power a corporation wields to do the same is only growing. It’s critical that the people have tools to resist this, and that those tools are ultimately owned by the people. Allowing a government or a few corporations to own the public conversation is a path towards centralized control.\n\nI’m a strong believer that any content produced by someone for the internet should be permanent until the original author chooses to delete it. It should be always available and addressable. Content takedowns and suspensions should not be possible. Doing so complicates important context, learning, and enforcement of illegal activity. There are significant issues with this stance of course, but starting with this principle will allow for far better solutions than we have today. The internet is trending towards a world were storage is “free” and infinite, which places all the actual value on how to discover and see content.\n\nWhich brings me to the last principle: moderation. I don’t believe a centralized system can do content moderation globally. It can only be done through ranking and relevance algorithms, the more localized the better. But instead of a company or government building and controlling these solely, people should be able to build and choose from algorithms that best match their criteria, or not have to use any at all. A “follow” action should always deliver every bit of content from the corresponding account, and the algorithms should be able to comb through everything else through a relevance lens that an individual determines. There’s a default “G-rated” algorithm, and then there’s everything else one can imagine.\n\nThe only way I know of to truly live up to these 3 principles is a free and open protocol for social media, that is not owned by a single company or group of companies, and is resilient to corporate and government influence. The problem today is that we have companies who own both the protocol and discovery of content. Which ultimately puts one person in charge of what’s available and seen, or not. This is by definition a single point of failure, no matter how great the person, and over time will fracture the public conversation, and may lead to more control by governments and corporations around the world. \n\nI believe many companies can build a phenomenal business off an open protocol. For proof, look at both the web and email. The biggest problem with these models however is that the discovery mechanisms are far too proprietary and fixed instead of open or extendable. Companies can build many profitable services that complement rather than lock down how we access this massive collection of conversation. There is no need to own or host it themselves.\n\nMany of you won’t trust this solution just because it’s me stating it. I get it, but that’s exactly the point. Trusting any one individual with this comes with compromises, not to mention being way too heavy a burden for the individual. It has to be something akin to what bitcoin has shown to be possible. If you want proof of this, get out of the US and European bubble of the bitcoin price fluctuations and learn how real people are using it for censorship resistance in Africa and Central/South America.\n\nI do still wish for Twitter, and every company, to become uncomfortably transparent in all their actions, and I wish I forced more of that years ago. I do believe absolute transparency builds trust. As for the files, I wish they were released Wikileaks-style, with many more eyes and interpretations to consider. And along with that, commitments of transparency for present and future actions. I’m hopeful all of this will happen. There’s nothing to hide…only a lot to learn from. The current attacks on my former colleagues could be dangerous and doesn’t solve anything. If you want to blame, direct it at me and my actions, or lack thereof.\n\nAs far as the free and open social media protocol goes, there are many competing projects: @bluesky is one with the AT Protocol, nostr another, Mastodon yet another, Matrix yet another…and there will be many more. One will have a chance at becoming a standard like HTTP or SMTP. This isn’t about a “decentralized Twitter.” This is a focused and urgent push for a foundational core technology standard to make social media a native part of the internet. I believe this is critical both to Twitter’s future, and the public conversation’s ability to truly serve the people, which helps hold governments and corporations accountable. And hopefully makes it all a lot more fun and informative again.\n\n💸🛠️🌐\nTo accelerate open internet and protocol work, I’m going to open a new category of #startsmall grants: “open internet development.” It will start with a focus of giving cash and equity grants to engineering teams working on social media and private communication protocols, bitcoin, and a web-only mobile OS. I’ll make some grants next week, starting with $1mm/yr to Signal. Please let me know other great candidates for this money.","created_at":1681241813,"id":"d3f509e5eb6dd06f96d4797969408f5f9c90e9237f012f83130b1fa592b26433","kind":30023,"pubkey":"82341f882b6eabcd2ba7f1ef90aad961cf074af15b9ef44a09f9d2a8fbfbe6a2","sig":"60010f2f4fa1ee9925df787a7914fe4e44fcf7c0b56767c078f9632d07e74da149f782491d0a6759f3f2dd128daad8b911b2ef6e50b658460aa8d1c258afd78b","tags":[["d","1681236782798"],["title","a native internet protocol for social media"],["summary",""],["published_at","1681237340"],["image","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/The_Sun_by_the_Atmospheric_Imaging_Assembly_of_NASA%27s_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory_-_20100819.jpg"]]}]"###,

Ähnliche Gedanken, wird wohl jeder schonmal gehabt haben, wenn es um das Thema Online-Accounts geht. Wer hat Zugang zu meinen Profilen, Accounts, und sonstigen Informationen und was passiert im Falle eines Unfalls, einer plötzlichen Krankheit, oder ähnlichen Szenarien? Um ehrlich zu sein, mir persönlich ist es egal, was mit meinem Gmail oder Youtube-Account passiert, jedoch bei Bitcoin ist das ein anderes Thema. Denn hier verbergen sich hinter den privaten Schlüsseln UTXOs mit einem reellen Wert. Und anders als bei Bankkonten oder anderen Anlagearten, lässt sich keine Bank oder andere Verwahrstelle kontaktieren, die den Hinterbliebenen Zugriff auf die Vermögenswerte bereitstellt.\n\nEine vernünftige Nachlassplanung ist also wirklich wichtig, denn wir möchten, dass unsere Opfer, die wir heute in Form von Arbeit und Zeitaufwand erbringen, in der Zukunft Früchte tragen und hoffentlich auch unseren Nachkommen zugutekommen. Jede Entscheidung, heute kein Geld für etwas auszugeben, dass einem selbst heute Spaß gemacht hätte, um in eine sicherere und angenehmere Zukunft zu investieren, sollte auch in der Zukunft belohnt werden. Es fühlt sich irgendwie kurzsichtig an, insbesondere wenn es um Bitcoin geht, nur an sich selbst zu denken (wen Lambo?), wenn es sich bei Bitcoin um einen Vermögenswert handelt, der die Fähigkeit besitzt, über mehrere Generationen in der Zukunft zu bestehen und vielleicht sogar seinen Wert zu steigern.\n\n➡️[#44 // KW12 // 23.3.2023 // Bitcoin ist Zeit 🕰️⚒️🕳️](https://genexyz.ghost.io/23-kw12/)\n\nEs muss also einen besseren Weg geben, als zu hoffen, dass der Ehepartner oder die Kinder in der Lage sind die bitcoins aus einem 24-Wörter-Seed wiederherzustellen, wenn man einmal nicht mehr ist, oder nicht mehr in der Lage ist, dies selbst zu veranlassen. Denn der Seedphrase ist in den meisten Fällen das bestgehütetste Geheimnis jedes Bitcoiners und wahrscheinlich haben die wenigsten zusätzlich einen Wiederherstellungsplan für ihre Hinterbliebenen angefertigt und versteckt. Wenn wir über die Nachlassplanung in Bitcoin nachdenken, gibt es einige Komplexitäten. Aber wenn man sich die Zeit nimmt, über alle Ergebnisse nachzudenken, die man erreichen möchte, gibt es einige wirklich wichtige Dinge, die getan werden können.\nTraurigerweise ist es kein angenehmer Gedanke, über den eigenen Tod nachzudenken und darüber, wie man seine bitcoins aus dem Grab heraus weitergeben soll. Ich habe vor längerer Zeit eine humoristische Aufstellung von verschiedenen Planungsmöglichkeiten aufgestellt, die man sich hier anschauen kann:\n\n➡️[#15 // KW34 // 25.8.2022 // Bitcoin und der Tod ☠️](https://genexyz.ghost.io/22-kw34/)\n\n\n\n> * Nichts tun\n> * Exchange plus Passwort\n> * Desktop Wallet\n> * Mobile Wallet\n> *  Paper Wallet zu Hause\n> * Paper Wallet im (Bank-)Safe\n>* Hardware Wallet zu Hause\n>* Hardware Wallet im (Bank-)Safe\n>* Multisig Lösung\n>* Custodial Service\n\nAllerdings ist das Thema wirklich kompliziert und nicht einfach zu lösen. Es gibt unterschiedliche persönliche Faktoren, wie das eigene Alter, der eigene Gesundheitszustand, in welchem familiären Konstrukt man lebt, wo man lebt, wie viel Bitcoin es zu verwahren und weiterzugeben gilt, usw. Darüber hinaus stellt sich auch die Frage, ob die Weitergabe professionell und im Einklang mit den aktuellen Rechtsstrukturen gemacht werden soll, denn dann ergeben sich sowohl aus steuerlicher als auch aus rechtlicher Sicht unterschiedliche Szenarien, die eventuell sogar erhebliche Vorteile bieten könnten. Darunter eine Reihe rechtlicher Vorzugsbehandlungen beim Schutz von Vermögenswerten, die über die eigenen Vorkehrungsmaßnahmen hinausgehen können. Aber dies soll kein steuerlicher oder juristischer Rat werden.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/Qo9KZKsWyTAAAAAC/legal-perfectly-legal.gif)\n\nBei Bitcoin dreht sich alles um den souveränen Besitz von Eigentum. Dazu gehört auch die Entscheidung, wie und an wen das Eigentum weitergegeben werden soll. Der Inhalt eines Testaments kann und wird in der Regel dann angefochten, wenn das Vermögen ungleich verteilt wird oder wenn es einem der Begünstigten gegenüber ungerecht erscheint. Daher ist es immer am besten, ein Testament so zu gestalten, dass es für alle Beteiligten fair erscheint, und zweitens ist es wichtig, eventuelle Einschränkungen für alle zu kommunizieren. Ein gutes Erwartungsmanagement hilft, Konflikte zu vermeiden. Das ist die erste Stufe.\n\n> If it's your keys, it's your bitcoin. If it's not your keys, it's not your bitcoin! That's a lesson that we all learned during Gox, so...let's try not to have to be taught that lesson again. — Andreas Antonopolous, 14. April 2016\n\nDie zweite Stufe ist ein wasserdichtes Setup der privaten Schlüssel. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin, ist in diesem Zusammenhang eine sehr wirkungsvolle Aussage. Anders als bei jedem anderen Vermögenswert auf der Welt kontrolliert derjenige, der die Schlüssel besitzt, die UTXOs. Ein Rechtsanspruch ist nicht möglich, da die Kryptographie einen deutlich höheren Stellenwert einnimmt als ein Rechtsanspruch. Es gibt den rechtlichen Anspruch auf Bitcoin (die Worte im Testament) und dann gibt es die praktische Anwendung des Eigentums oder der Verteilung dessen (die Kontrolle der Schlüssel). Bei anderen Vermögenswerten wie Grundbesitz (Immobilien), Anleihen, Aktien, Rohstoffen usw. besteht immer die Möglichkeit, Berufung einzulegen. Wenn also etwas nicht in Ordnung zu sein scheint, die Vermögenswerte nicht auffindbar sind oder es andere Streitigkeiten gibt, ist es jederzeit möglich, sich an die jeweilige Behörde zu wenden und Berufung einzulegen.Es ist jederzeit möglich, sich an eine offizielle Stelle oder ein Amt zu wenden und zu argumentieren, dass man einen Anspruch hat, um dann die Behörde dazu zu veranlassen, den Vermögenswert auf den eigenen Namen übertragen zu lassen.\n\nBei Bitcoin gibt es keine solche Behörde. Wenn eine/r der Begünstigten nicht über die privaten Schlüssel verfügt, die unmissverständlich Auskunft über den Besitz geben, stellt das für den/die Begünstigte/n ein großes Problem dar. Die korrekte Gestaltung der Eigentumsverteilung hat also einige schwerwiegende Konsequenzen. Ähnlich wie die Verantwortung und Rechenschaftspflicht, die mit dem Besitz von Bitcoin in Eigenverwahrung einhergeht (und dort eigentlich wirklich beginnt), fügt die Nachlassplanung dem Prozess des Todes und der anschließenden Übertragung von Vermögenswerten eine völlig neue Dimension hinzu.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/BLx2QTYseZ4AAAAC/die-wynonna.gif)\n\n**Das Hauptproblem besteht also darin, wie der/die Eigentümer//in der bitcoins den vollständigen und einseitigen Zugriff behalten und gleichzeitig den Erben oder Begünstigten direkt oder einem Testamentsvollstrecker Zugriff gewähren kann, um das Vermögen an die Erben oder Begünstigten zu verteilen.**\n\nDer Kniff liegt darin, die volle Kontrolle zu behalten und gleichzeitig das Eigentum so zu gestalten, dass die Erben auch bei einem plötzlichen und unerwarteten Ereignis Zugriff haben, und das im besten Fall, ohne sich auf Dritte verlassen zu müssen, um dem Bitcoin Ethos gerecht zu werden. Dieses Ereignis muss nicht zwingend der Tod sein, es reicht schon, wenn man handlungsunfähig wird.\n\nDenn oft wird vergessen, dass eine gute Nachlassregelung auch dann wichtig ist, wenn der Eigentümer nicht stirbt. Eine Person kann sich auch verletzen, sich den Kopf stoßen oder auf andere Weise die volle Kontrolle über ihre Fähigkeiten verlieren, was bedeutet, dass sie möglicherweise auch den Zugang (die Erinnerung) zu ihrem Vermögen, einschließlich ihrer bitcoins, verliert.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/o9oQIkAyBS4AAAAC/michael-schumacher-formula1.gif)\n\nBei Bitcoin gibt es keine einheitliche Lösung, sondern nur Kompromisse. Das gilt auch für so viele andere Dinge, wie zum Beispiel das Trilemma, bei dem Skalierbarkeit der Sicherheit und Dezentralisierung geopfert wird, oder die Selbstverwaltung, bei der Benutzerfreundlichkeit und Komfort in gewissem Maße der Sicherheit und Privatsphäre geopfert werden.\n\nDeshalb sollte man sich der Wahl der persönlichen Lösung über die Kompromisse Gedanken machen, die es einem erlauben, den Kompromiss zu wählen, der einem am besten gefällt, am besten zur persönlichen Situation passt und mit dem man sich am sichersten fühlt. Ich habe oben z.B. \"Nichts tun\" aufgeführt; vielleicht hat der ein oder andere Bitcoiner keine Familie, keine Kinder und keine Personen, die ihm/ihr nahe stehen, oder vielleicht doch, aber sie sind es nicht wert mit dem ersparten, wertvollen Bitcoin bedacht zu werden. In diesem Fall, danke für die Spende an das Netzwerk.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/zqdJh5BZlyAAAAAC/you-have-a-generous-heart-joe-biden.gif)\n\nSich mit Lösungen vertraut zu machen, die Kontrolle und Verantwortung in den Vordergrund stellen und die Abhängigkeit von einem einzigen Gerät oder einem einzigen Schlüssel, sowie die Abhängigkeit von einer einzelnen Person ausschließen, da diese potenzielle Angriffsvektoren und einzelne Fehlerquellen darstellen, bedeutet, dass man für sich selbst ein Bewusstsein schafft, wie Selbstverwahrung und die daraus entstehenden Konsequenzen im Allgemeinen funktionieren. Nutzer//innen fühlen sich bei der Selbstverwahrung ihrer bitcoins immer wohler, sobald sie verstehen, dass der Verlust eines einzelnen Schlüssels nicht sofort den Verlust des Zugriffs auf das gesicherte Vermögen bedeutet - sofern das richtige Setup gewählt wurde. Es ist wirklich wichtig, dass der Anteil derjenigen, die Bitcoin in Selbstverwahrung halten, vergrößert wird, denn es ist wichtig, dass jeder einzelne bitcoin – der nicht aktiv gehandelt wird – von den Börsen entfernt wird, und gleichzeitig Nutzer//innen mit der Materie der Selbstverwahrung vertraut werden.\n\n![](https://genexyz.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/image-16.png)\n\nDenn wie auf der Grafik zu sehen ist, liegen schätzungsweise immer noch über 2,3 Millionen bitcoins auf Börsen. Bei einer Menge von 19,4 Millionen Bitcoin im Umlauf, reduziert um die Anzahl verlorener bitcoins und Satoshis bitcoins (19,4 - 3 - 1,1 = 15,3), ist es mit 15% aller existierenden bitcoins ein immer noch zu hoher Prozentsatz. Erschwerend kommt hinzu, dass von den 2,3 Millionen bitcoins auf Börsen sich der Großteil auf Binance und Coinbase befindet, also die beiden Namen, die gerade im Kreuzfeuer der SEC stehen. Zum Glück gibt es einen Trend zum Rückgang des Anteils von auf Börsen gehaltenen bitcoins, gemessen an der Umlaufmenge, da Bitcoin dank persönlicher Verwahrungslösungen, welche im Laufe der Zeit immer gängiger und robuster werden, immer mehr auf seine eigentlichen Nutzer verteilt wird.\n\nDas Abheben von Bitcoin von den Börsen hat nicht nur den zusätzlichen Vorteil, dass die Bitcoin-Bestände sicherer sind und die Nutzer//innen mehr Vertrauen haben, dass ihre Ersparnisse tatsächlich vorhanden sind und nicht weiter verpfändet wurden. Sondern ohne Bitcoin auf den Börsen und daher ohne Papier-Bitcoin ist auch eine echte Preisfindung wieder möglich, welche heute von den Börsen verzerrt wird.\n\nZurück zur Nachlassplanung: Letztendlich ist es am wichtigsten, dafür zu sorgen, dass die gewählte Methode dafür sorgt, dass die Schlüssel und die dazugehörigen bitcoins sicher und zuverlässig zu den Erben oder Begünstigten gelangen, ohne dabei zu viele Kompromisse einzugehen oder zu viele Angriffsvektoren zu schaffen.\n\nEs gibt sogar komplizierte Modelle, in denen z.B. ein Trust gegründet (abhängig von der Gerichtsbarkeit, in der man sich befindet), bei der der Eigentümer einen gesetzlichen Auftrag erteilt, dass die Begünstigten oder Erben als Teil des Trusts ein Einkommen in Höhe eines bestimmten Prozentsatzes beziehen können. Dieses Verfahren könnte von den jeweiligen Gerichtsbarkeiten rechtlich angefochten werden, aber wenn das Setup kryptografisch eingerichtet und ausgeführt wird, ohne das eine Partei Einfluss auf diese Ausführung nehmen kann, kann man von Rechts wegen nichts dagegen tun, da kein Testamentsvollstrecker oder keine andere Partei gezwungen werden kann, den Auszahlungsmechanismus zu ändern, da dies mechanisch unmöglich ist. Denn wie wir wissen, übertrifft die Kryptographie jegliche rechtliche Ansprüche. Dies ist eine einzigartige Funktion von Bitcoin, die kein anderer Vermögenswert auf der Welt besitzt. Es ist ein sehr wirksames Instrument, um Eigentum und Besitz langfristig zu sichern und sicherzustellen, dass Eigentum innerhalb des Personenkreises (Freunde, Familie, Bekannte, Geschäftspartner) bleibt, bei dem es bleiben soll.\n\nÜber diese einzigartige Eigenschaft von Bitcoin wird in der Regel nicht viel gesprochen. Man könnte sogar argumentieren, dass der Tausch von anderem Eigentum in Bitcoin vor der Übergabe an Erben oder Begünstigte eine strategisch sinnvolle Option ist, um die korrekte Ausführung seines Testaments zu kontrollieren – auch aus dem Grab heraus.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/IVTr6Y7cSeYAAAAC/zombie-dead.gif)\n\nDie Nachlassplanung bei Bitcoin ist die letzte Stufe der Evolution. Der erste Schritt besteht darin, sich über Bitcoin zu informieren und genug darüber zu verstehen, um Interesse an der Materie zu wecken. Dieser erste Schritt ist ein fortlaufender Prozess, der jeden Bitcoiner auf seiner Reise begleiten wird, da es unmöglich ist, jeden Aspekt und jede Interpretation des Themas vollständig zu verstehen. Man hört nie auf zu lernen. Der Honigdachsbau ist unendlich tief.\n\n![](https://genexyz.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/image-19.png)\n\nDieser erste Schritt muss genug Interesse an Bitcoin und den umliegenden Themenfeldern wecken, dass man den zweiten Schritt geht: Bitcoin zu erwerben. Im diesem Sinne spielt es zunächst keine Rolle, wie man in den Besitz von Bitcoin gelangt, ob man Bitcoin kauft, durch Mining produziert, \"findet\" oder auf andere Weise erhält. Wichtig ist, dass man in den Besitz von Bitcoin gelangt und es nun aufbewahren muss.\n\nDenn das ist Schritt drei, die sichere und solide Aufbewahrung der Bitcoin-Vermögenswerte in einer selbstverwalteten und selbstverwahrenden Art und Weise. Dazu gehören auch Setups, an denen bis zu einem gewissen Grad Dritte, wie z.B. andere bekannte Personen oder Verwahrungsdienste beteiligt sein können. Wichtig ist, dass die Schlüssel jederzeit vollständig zugänglich und damit Transaktionen vollständig ausführbar sind. Aus diesem Grund ist jede Speicheroption ausgeschlossen, bei der die Schlüssel ausschließlich von Dritten gehalten werden, wie z.B. von Börsen, Brokern oder anderen Verleih- oder Speicherplattformen – not your keys, not your Bitcoin!\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/FRB3kEL8T0oAAAAC/say-the-line-bart-not-your-keys-not-your-coins.gif)\n\nDer letzte Schritt in diesem persönlichen Entwicklungsprozess ist die Zukunftssicherheit dieser Vermögenswerte. Da die bitcoins nun sicher aufbewahrt sind, muss sichergestellt werden, dass es einen Weg zur Wiederherstellung oder Vererbung gibt, falls etwas passiert. Dies ist einfach der logische Evolutionsprozess, den jeder durchlaufen muss, der Bitcoin langfristig besitzen möchte.\n\n![](https://genexyz.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/image-17.png)\n\nBesonders in einer Zeit, in der die SEC zwei der größten kRyPto-Börsen der Welt auf den Leib rückt, muss man sich der Realität bewusst werden, dass Dritte, selbst wenn sie scheinbar groß und etabliert sind, nicht für immer existieren werden. Bitcoiner fordern schon seit langem alle und jede/n dazu auf, ihre bitcoins von den Börsen zu nehmen. Jeder, der dachte, dass es eine gute Idee sei, Bitcoin kurzfristig an Börsen zu halten, wurde bereits mehrfach an diesen Trugschluss erinnert - Mt. Gox, Bitfinex und FTX - um nur die großen zu nennen. Wer denkt, dass es eine gute Idee sei, bitcoins auf Börsen zu lagern, um schließlich nur ein Stück Papier mit den Zugangsdaten an die Erben weiterzugeben, der begeht einen schrecklichen Fehler. Die bisherigen Ausführungen sollten dies klar gemacht haben.\n\nIch habe absichtlich keine Vorschläge gemacht, wie ein sicheres Setup aussehen soll. Wie schon gesagt, gibt es keine eine richtige Lösung - nur Kompromisse. Der persönliche Kompromiss hängt von zu vielen Faktoren ab, so dass man eine einheitliche Lösung anbieten kann. Man sollte sich jedoch die folgenden Punkte merken:\n\n1. Früh genug mit der Planung beginnen - hinter jeder Ecke lauert ein Bär!\n2. Das Einschließen von Dritten in die Nachlassplanung sollte mit Bedacht gewählt und gründlich überlegt sein.\n3. Das gewählte Setup sollte mindestens einmal getestet werden, bevor der schlimmste Fall eintritt.\n4. Es ist immer ratsam, die mit dem Nachlass bedachten Personen aufzuklären, dass im schlimmsten Fall etwas auf sie zukommt.\n\n🫳🎤","id":"b5637dfb45cf71e4f84bed9235cf7c57dd839c75459432b0d2394ed850f4301a","created_at":1687507059,"sig":"6ae49ac8fa4bd3a7488aebc73148e8710563b4eeeb6b49493deeea61e6e38ac2551ac26564fcfd806882fd3f7f41c82916af117655876623e0d48e2605681cdb","kind":30023,"tags":[["d","1687506455492"],["title","#57 // KW25 // 22.6.2023 // Die Zukunft planen ⚰️🔮🗺️"],["summary","Wie sichert man seinen Bitcoin-Besitz in Eigenverwahrung gleichzeitig zuverlässig und gewährt Angehörigen Zugriff, falls der  Ernstfall eintritt?
